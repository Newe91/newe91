        <h2>Unit 1: Assess technical and user documentation</h2>
        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p><b>Documentation</b> may refer to the process of providing evidence or to the communicable material used to provide such documentation.</p>

        <h3>User documentation</h3>
        <p>User documentation also known as end-user documentation is any form of documentation
            intended for the end-user of a product or a service.
            <b>The purpose of this documentation</b> is to guide
            the users on how to properly install, use or troubleshoot a product.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of user documentation</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li><b>Installation/setup guide:</b> it use step-by-step instructions to make the overall process user-friendly.</li>
                <li><b>Comprehensive user manual:</b> this refers to the complete, in-depth user guide that comes with any product with even the
                    slightest learning curve for any product.</li>
                <li><b>Reference guides</b></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>There are a lot of elements that makes user documentation great such as:-</h3>

                <li>Reduces burden on your support team</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Technical documentation</h3>
        <p>Technical documentation is any piece of writing that describes the application, purpose, creation
            or architecture of a product or service. Its goal is to explain something that an organization
            offers.
        </p>

        <h3>Importance of technical documentation</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>It provides essential information about a product
                    or service</li>
                <li>Increase productivity and efficiency</li>
                <li>Save money on customer service and replacements</li>
                <li>Correctly and refer to the user guide to troubleshoot
                    their own problems</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Examples of technical documentation</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>User instructions</li>
                <li>Operating instructions</li>
                <li>Servicing instructions</li>
                <li>Installation manuals</li>
                <li>Software manual</li>

                <li>Report</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Main types of technical documentation</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>Process documentation</b> <p>Process documentation describes the development of a product. The audience for this type of
                    documentation comprises internal members and clients. There's usually some documentation
                    describing every stage of the development life cycle. For example, at the beginning of a project,
                    there are project proposals and then plans that include timelines, milestones and data about the
                    budget. Later, the project manager might submit progress reports or documents detailing step-bystep procedures
                    </p></li>
                <li><b>User documentation</b><p>User documents which are also called <b>product-based documents</b> relate to products in their
                    finished state. The audience for user documents is usually the end-user. The documents may
                    explain how to install, start-up, troubleshoot or repair a product. Alternatively, they may describe
                    the various features and how to use them or answer frequently asked questions. Companies often
                    package such documents with the product but also provide them online, so they're accessible
                    through the customer support page.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Best practices for writing technical documentation</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Have a plan</li>
                <li>Have a consistent style</li>
                <li>Understand your audience</li>
                <li>Be as concise as possible</li>
                <li>Optimize for different platforms and devices</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Difference between technical and user documentation</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Technical documentation is a broader term than user documentation</li>
                <li>Technical documentation can be internal and external, while user documentation is
                    always created for end-user</li>
                <li>The process of creating user documentation requires a minimum technical background
                    compared with technical documentation</li>
                <li>User documentation is meant for the end-user, whereas technical documentation is meant
                    for everyone else</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Effective and appropriate forms of communications</h3>
        <p>Communication is the exchange of information and meaning between people. It occurs when one
            person understands and responds to the meaning of a message sent by someone else. The
            communication process includes five main components: the information source, the signal, the
            transmission, the destination or receiver and the noise.</p>
        <h3>Barriers to effective communication</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Noise</li>
                <li>Ambiguous</li>
                <li>Muddled messages</li>
                <li>Semantics</li>
                <li>Physical barriers</li>
                <li>Loss of transmission</li>
                <li>Failing to communicate</li>
                <li>Competition barriers</li>
                <li>Cultural</li>
                <li>Linguistic</li>
                <li>Not listening</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Elements of communication process</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li><b>Communicator:</b> can be manager is the communicator, source, speaker, issuer or writer
                    who intends to convey or transmit a message, subordinates, customers, clients,
                    workmates as well as external parties. Communicator plays an important role in the
                    communication process.</li>
                <li><b>Encoding:</b> this is the second element in the communication process. It refers to preparing
                    the subject of communication (idea, fact, information etc) in a very convenient or suitable
                    language.</li>
                <li><b>Message:</b> the encoded message needs to be transmitted by appropriate means. It may be
                    in verbal or written form depending on the purpose.</li>
                <li><b>Medium:</b> the medium of communication carries the message from the communicator to
                    the receiver. Face to face, verbal communication, use of telephone, inter-com facilities,
                    issue of memorandum, notice, circulars, statements, telegraphs, telex, etc are the various
                    means of communication.</li>
                <li><b>Decoding:</b> refers to the conversation of the message by the receiver into
                    meaningful terms so as to make it understandable. This is another important element of
                    communication because the receiver's response depends upon his/her understanding of
                    the content and purpose of the message.</li>
                <li><b>Receiver:</b> the receiver of the message has an equally very important role to play as the
                    communicator.</li>
                <li><b>Feed back:</b> communicator is the originator of the message. The actual response of the
                    receiver to the message communicated to him/her is known as feedback.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <h3>Level of communication</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>
                    <b>Upward communication</b>
                    <p>Upward communication from subordinates to superiors provides management with valuable
                        insight into how the organization is functioning and provides superiors with feedback about
                        whether subordinates understand orders and instructions. It gives employees an opportunity to
                        vent their feelings.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Downward communication</b>
                    <p>Downward communication is transmitted from superior to subordinate on subjects like corporate
                        vision and mission, what the job consists of, performance evaluations, job instruction and
                        organizational policies and practices. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Horizontal communication</b>
                    <p>Horizontal or lateral communications are messages between departments or people in the same
                        department. Managers use individuals or committees to bridge departments and improve the flow
                        of communication between them by using liaison personnel, committees and task forces and
                        independent integrators</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Team work plans development</h3>
        <p>A well developed work plan provides clear and specific guidance pertaining to the staffing,
            timeline and costs associated with the implementation of conservation actions. A work plan
            identifies the specific tasks that need to be completed, associated with a conservation action plan.</p>
        <h3>The work plan helps the project team to:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Ensure all the essential tasks in the project are planned and reduces the chance of
                    overlooking an essential step in completing the project.</li>
                <li>Allocate tasks efficiently to individuals without duplication of effort</li>
                <li>Establish short-term priorities and individual performance expectations</li>
                <li>Establish a project schedule that can be tracked and monitored</li>
                <li>Set expectations for project progress and establish accountability</li>
                <li>Analyze problem areas more effectively</li>
                <li>Develop a more accurate budget</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>The following five steps are typically carried out during the process of developing a useful work
            plan:-</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Identify specific action steps that need to be done</li>
                <li>Define who will be responsible for each action step</li>
                <li>Determine when each action step will take place</li>
                <li>Estimate resources required for each action step</li>
                <li>Revisit and revise the work plan on a regular basis</li>
