            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <h3>Overview of internal and external hardware peripherals and software </h3>
            <p><b>Computer hardware</b> refers to the physical parts of a computer and related
                devices. <b>The internal hardware parts of a computer are often referred to as components, while external
                hardware devices are usually called peripherals.</b> Together, they all fall under the category of
                computer hardware.<br>Internal hardware devices include motherboards, hard drives, and RAM.
                External hardware devices include monitors, keyboards, mice, printers and scanners etc.
                <br><b>Peripheral devices</b> are the devices that are attached to the computer's system unit.
                <br><b>Software</b> on the other hand, consists of the programs and applications that run on
                computers. Because software runs on computer hardware, software programs often have
                system requirements that list the minimum hardware required for the software to run.
            </p>

            <h3>Motherboard</h3>
            <p>The motherboard is the body or mainframe of the computer,
                through which all other components interface. It is the central
                circuit board making up a complex electronic system. A
                motherboard provides the electrical connections by which the
                other components of the system communicate.
                The mother board includes many components such as: central
                processing unit(CPU), random access memory(RAM),
                firmware and internal and external buses.<br><b>The meaning of form factors of motherboadrd</b> it determines the specifications on how a motherboard is built, from the size, shape, casing, power supply, mounting holes, and the overall layout.<br>
                <b>Form factors of a motherboard:-</b>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Full-AT</b>
                        <p>It had dimensions of 12 x 13.8 and was primarily used in IBM PC-compatible systems.
                            Full-AT motherboards were larger in size compared to modern standards and were designed to accommodate the Intel 80386 processor.
                            Due to its large size, Full-AT motherboards were not compatible with smaller cases or newer form factors that emerged later.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Baby-AT</b>
                        <p>Baby-AT form factor was an evolution of the Full-AT design, introduced to address some of its limitations.
                            Baby-AT motherboards were smaller than Full-AT boards but still relatively large by today's standards.
                            The reduced size of Baby-AT boards made them more compatible with smaller computer cases while still offering expansion slots for components.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>ATX(Advanced Technology Extended)</b>
                        <p>ATX is one of the most common motherboard form factors. It typically measures 12 × 9.6 inches and is widely used in desktop computers. ATX motherboards offer multiple expansion slots, support for various processors and ample space for components.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Micro-ATX</b>
                        <p>Micro-ATX is a smaller form factor compared to ATX, measuring around 9.6 × 9.6 inches. It is popular for smaller builds and budget-friendly systems while still offering decent expansion capabilities.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Mini-ITX</b>
                        <p>Mini-ITX is the smallest common form factor, measuring just 6.7 × 6.7 inches. Despite its compact size, Mini-ITX motherboards can support powerful components and are often used in small form factor PCs, HTPCs(Home Theater PCs) and compact gaming rigs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Nano-ITX</b>
                        <p>The Nano-ITX is another type of motherboard form factor, that measures 4.7 × 4.7 in. Nano-ITX are fully integrated boards designed to consume very low power. This type of motherboard can be used in many applications, but it was specially designed for smart entertainment, like PVRs, media centers, smart TVs, in-vehicle devices and more.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Full-ATX</b>
                        <p>Full-ATX motherboards are larger than standard ATX boards, measuring 305 x 330 mm (12 x 13 inches). The extra size allows for more expansion slots and additional features compared to ATX motherboards. Full-ATX boards are often used in high-performance systems that require multiple graphics cards, extensive storage options or advanced cooling solutions.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Mini ATX</b>
                        <p>Mini-ATX motherboards are designed as a smaller alternative to the standard ATX form factor, which measures 284 x 208 mm (11.2 x 8.2 in) in v2.1 specifications. The Mini-ATX form factor was developed to address the needs of home theater PCs, industrial applications and other systems where size is a critical factor. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>NLX</b>
                        <p>NLX was a low-cost and low-profile form factor introduced in the late 1990s by Intel for compact computers.
                            NLX motherboards utilized a riser board for expansion cards and add-on cards to save space within the case.
                            NLX form factor did not gain widespread adoption and was eventually superseded by Micro ATX and other smaller form factors.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>LPX</b>
                        <p>The LPX, which stands for Landing Platform, Experimental, is a new concept in the Dutch Marine Corps that involves the replacement of the current LPD (Landing Platform Dock) ships with a new class of ships designated as LPX. These LPX ships are designed to enhance the capabilities of the Dutch Marine Corps by providing greater speed, mobility, flexibility, and firepower for operations at sea. The LPX concept aims to enable the Dutch Marine Corps to operate more effectively in both maritime and amphibious environments.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        <b>Scanner</b>
                        <p>A scanner is a device that captures text or illustrations on paper and
                        converts the information into a form the computer can use. One of the
                        most common kinds of scanners is called a flatbed scanner. It has a glass
                        surface on which you lay paper, magazines, or other documents that you
                        want to scan.</p>

            <h3>System specifications</h3>
            <p>It is important to find out the specifications of the computer system you are planning to
            connect the peripheral device to. Many newer types of peripheral devices require a
            specific amount of memory, CPU speed, hard disk space, and may only be compatible
            with certain operating systems.
            <br>You also need to be aware of the peripheral's system requirements. The manual for the
            peripheral device as well as the manufacturer's website will help you determine the
            minimum system specifications. </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>Compatibility is the ability of a system or a product to work with other systems or
            products without special effort on the part of the customer. One way products achieve
            interoperability is to comply with industry interface standards. For example, a memory
            module is compatible with a motherboard because the manufacturer of the memory
            module and the motherboard both work to the same industry standard.</p>

            </p>

            <h3>Ask questions to help you identify the possible cause. Questions to ask include:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>What are the symptoms?</li>
                    <li>Are there any error messages or error tones? Some devices may report the fault and the action to take.</li>
                    <li>Has any new software or hardware been added recently?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Power on self test(POST)</h3>
            <p>During POST, the BIOS performs testing of hardware components. If a device is faulty an error message may be displayed. At this stage you can also check the computer's BIOS settings to see if the settings are the cause of the problem.</p>

            <h3>Operating system diagnostics</h3>
            <p>Once the operating system is loaded, it will also perform its own hardware test and load device drivers for peripheral devices. If you are using a Windows operating system, Device Manager reports on devices connected and their status.</p>

            <h3>Warranty</h3>
            <p>When computer hardware devices are purchased, the supplier provides a guarantee that if a fault develops in the equipment within a certain time, they will repair or replace it free of charge. 
                Organizations need to consider the warranty conditions before purchasing to ensure their business needs will be met.<br> <b>Common warranty conditions include:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>The length of the warranty - typically one or more years.</li>
                    <li>The actions needed to have the repairs undertaken. Either the repairs will be done on-site or the equipment will need to be returned to the supplier, known as return-to-base.</li>
                    <li>How long the supplier has to make good any required repairs.</li>
                    <li>Any exclusions to the warranty, such as damage caused to hardware by accidental damage.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Organizational policies</h3>
            <p>Some organizations have a policy of using preferred suppliers for computer hardware purchases. This ensures the quality and consistency of computer hardware devices is maintained throughout an organization.
                <br><b>Standard operating environment</b> is a specification for computer hardware and software which organizations develop to maintain consistency and reduce support costs.  Many organizations such as universities, publish their standard operating environment policies on the internet. For an example, visit the Edith Cowan University Standard Operating Environment website . 
            </p>

            <h3>Safe electrical work practices</h3>
            <p>Computer hardware should be located close to a suitable electrical outlet. The use of long extension cords is a trip hazard. If no power outlet is available, a new fixed power outlet may need to be installed. Any fixed electrical installation is required by law to be installed by a licensed electrician.
                Cables should be kept away from the floor, and a person's workspace. Cables on the floor are easily damaged by trolleys and chair castors.
                <br>Use switched power boards and not double adapters or piggy backed plugs.
                Routinely inspect cables for any damage. Damaged cables should be disconnected and removed.
                <br>Testing and tagging refers to the practice of testing electrical equipment (which is designed for connection by a flexible cord), by an appropriate person. If the equipment is compliant a tag is attached which is marked with the name of the person or company who performed the test, and the test date or retest date.
                Any component such as a computer power supply which has a mains (240 volt) power connection can only be opened and repaired by a qualified technician. CRT monitors can have very high electrical potential levels even after they have been switched off and must only be opened by a qualified technician.
                Electrical circuits for fixed wiring are protected from overload by a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker will trip if the circuit is overloaded. If this happens, it is an indication that the number of electrical appliances on that circuit should be reduced.
            </p>


            <h3>Network threats</h3>
            <p>Network threats are intentional activities to cause damage, misusing resources or other aggressive action on network system</p>

            <h3>Ways to monitor threats to the network</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>By using software Utilities</li>
                    <li>By using security mechanism</i>
                    <li>By Using encryption facilities.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Computer security and network security</h3>
            <p><b>Computer security</b> the prevention and protection of computer assets from unauthorized access, use, alteration, degradation, destruction and other threats.
                <br><b>Network security</b> involves the authorization of access to data in a network which is controlled by the network administrator and the organization policies. Users choose or an ID and password or authenticating information that allows them access to information and program within their authority. 
            </p>

            <h3>Importance of security</h3>
            <p>Computer and network security help to keep data and equipment functioning and provide
            access only to appropriate people. Everyone in an organization should give high priority to
            security because everyone can be affected by a lapse in security.
            Theft, loss, network intrusion and physical damage are some of the ways a network or
            computer can be harmed. Damage or loss of equipment can mean a loss of productivity.
            Repairing and replacing equipment can cost the company time and money. Unauthorized use of
            a network can expose confidential information and reduce network resources.</p>
        
            <h3>Two types of security threats</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Physical</b> Events or attacks that steal, damage, or destroy equipment, such as servers, switches, and
                        wiring.</li>
                    <li><b>Data</b> Events or attacks that remove, corrupt, deny access, allow access or steal information.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Threats to security  can come from:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Internal</b> Employees have access to data, equipment and the network.

                        network or resources.
                        <ul class="kb">
                            <li>Unstructured - Attackers use available resources, such as passwords or scripts,
                                to gain access and run programs designed to vandalize.</li>
                            <li>Structured - Attackers use code to access operating systems and software.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Privacy </h3>
            <p><b>Privacy</b> the right of the individual to be protected against interruption into his personal life or affairs, or those of his family, by direct physical means or by publication of information.

            </p>

            <h2>Common computer and network threats </h2>
            <h3>1.Viruses</h3>
            <p>A software virus is a parasitic program written intentionally to alter the way your computer
            operates without your permission or knowledge.
            <br>A virus attaches copies of it to other files such as program files or documents and is inactive
            until you run an infected program or open an infected document. When activated, a virus may
            damage or delete files, cause erratic system behavior, display messages or even erase your hard
            disk.
            <br>A virus may spread through email and instant messenger attachments, through infected files on
            floppy disks or CD-ROMs, or by exploiting a security flaw in Microsoft Windows.
            </p>

            <h3>2.Worm</h3>
            <p>A worm is a self-replicating program that is harmful to networks. A worm uses the network to
            duplicate its code to the hosts on a network, often without any user intervention. It is different
            from a virus because a worm does not need to attach to a program to infect a host. Even if the
            worm does not damage data or applications on the hosts it infects, it is harmful to networks
            because it consumes bandwidth.</p>

            <h3>3.Trojan horse</h3>
            <p>The Trojan does not need to be attached to other software. Instead, a Trojan threat is hidden in
            software that appears to do one thing and yet behind the scenes it does another. Trojans are
            often disguised as useful software. The Trojan program can reproduce like a virus and spread to
            other computers.A Trojan horse is not a virus because it does not replicate and spread like a virus.
            ><b>Solution</b> Security suites, such as Norton Internet Security, will prevent you from downloading Trojan Horses. 
            </p>

            <h3>4.Adware and spyware</h3>
            <p><b>Adware</b> is a software program that displays advertising on your computer. Adware is usually
            distributed with downloaded software. Most often, adware is displayed in a popup window.
            Adware popup windows are sometimes difficult to control and will open new windows faster
            than users can close them.
            <br><b>Spyware</b> a type of gray ware, is similar to adware. It is distributed without any user
            intervention or knowledge. Once installed, the spyware monitors activity on the computer. The
            spyware then sends this information to the organization responsible for launching the spyware.</p>

            <h3>5.Spam</h3>
            <p>Spam is flooding the Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it. 
                <br>SPAM may not be the biggest risk to a network because even though it may get maddening and plentiful it still doesn't destroy any physical elements of the network. 
                <b>Solution</b> spam filters are an effective way to stop SPAM, these filters come with most of the e-mail providers on line. Also you can buy a variety of SPAM filters that work effectively. 
            </p>

            <h3>6.Phishing</h3>
            <p>Phishing is an e-mail fraud method in which the performer sends out legitimate-looking emails in an attempt to gather personal and financial information from recipients. Phishing is one of the worst security threats over a network because a lot of people that use computers linked up to a network are unpaid and would be very vulnerable to giving out information that could cause situations such as theft of money or identity theft. 
                <b>Solution</b> similar to SPAM use Phishing filters to filter out this unwanted mail and to prevent threat. 
            </p>

            <h3>7.Packet sniffers</h3>
            <p>A packet sniffer is a device or program that allows listen on traffic traveling between networked computers. The packet sniffer will capture data that is addressed to other machines, saving it for later analysis.  
                In a network a packet sniffer can filter out personal information and this can lead to areas such as identity theft so this is a major security threat to a network.
                <b>Solution</b> obtain strong encryption. 
            </p>

            <h3>8.Maliciously coded websites</h3>
            <p>Some websites across the net contain code that is malicious. 
            <b>Solution</b> Using a security suite, such as AVG, can detect infected sites and try to prevent the user from entering the site. 
            </p>

            <h3>9.Password attacks</h3>
            <p>Password attacks are attacks by hackers that are able to determine passwords or find passwords to different protected electronic areas. 
            </p>

            <h3>10.Zombie computers and botnets</h3>
            <p>A zombie computer or drone is a computer that has been secretly compromised by hacking tools which allow a third party to control the computer and its resources remotely.  
            A hacker could hack into a computer and control the computer and obtain data. 
            <b>Solution</b> Antivirus software can help prevent zombie computers and also network intrusion prevention(NIP) systems can help prevent botnets
            </p>

            <h3>11.Denial of service(Doss)</h3>
            <p>Denial of service(Doss) is a form of attack that prevents users from accessing normal services,
                such as e-mail and a web server, because the system is busy responding to abnormally large
                amounts of requests. Doss works by sending enough requests for a system resource that the
                requested service is overloaded and ceases to operate.
                <br><b>Common  Denial of service(Doss) including:-</b>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Ping of death</b> A series of repeated, larger than normal pings that crash the receivingcomputer.</li>
                    <li><b>E-mail bomb</b> A large quantity of bulk e-mail that overwhelms the e-mail server
                        preventing users from accessing it. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>12.Distributed Doss(DDoS) </h3>
            <p>Distributed Doss(DDoS) is another form of attack that uses many infected computers, called
                zombies, to launch an attack. With DDoS, the intent is to obstruct or overwhelm access to the
                targeted server. Zombie computers located at different geographical locations make it difficult
                to trace the origin of the attack.</p>

            <h3>13.Hackers</h3>
            <p>A social engineer(hacker) is a person who is able to gain access to equipment or a network by
                tricking people into providing the necessary access information. Often, the social engineer gains
                the confidence of an employee and convinces the employee to divulge username and password
                information.<br>
                <b>Here are some basic precautions to help protect against Hackers:-</b>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li>Never give out your password</li>
                    <li>Always ask for the ID of unknown persons</li>
                    <li>Restrict access of unexpected visitors</li>
                    <li>Escort all visitors</li>
                    <li>Never post your password in your work area</li>
                    <li>Lock your computer when you leave your desk </li>
                    <li>Don't unsecure website</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Ways to protect data</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Password protection</b>
                        <p>Password protection can prevent unauthorized access to content. All computers should be
                            password protected.<br><b>Two levels of password protection are recommended:-</b>
                            <ul class="kb">
                                <li><b>BIOS</b> Prevents BIOS settings from being changed without the appropriate password.</li>
                                <li><b>Login</b> Prevents unauthorized access to the network.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Data encryption</b>
                        <p>Encrypting data uses codes and ciphers. Traffic between resources and computers on the
                            network can be protected from attackers monitoring or recording transactions by implementing
                            encryption. It may not be possible to decipher captured data in time to make any use of it.
                            <br>Virtual private network(VPN) uses encryption to protect data. A VPN connection allows a
                            remote user to safely access resources as if their computer is physically attached to the local
                            network.</p>

                        <b>Port protection</b>
                        <p>Every communication using TCP/IP is associated with a port number. HTTPS, for instance, uses
                            port 443 by default. A firewall is a way of protecting a computer from intrusion through the
                            ports. The user can control the type of data sent to a computer by selecting which ports will be
                            open and which will be secured. Data being transported on a network is called traffic.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Data backups</b>
                        <p>Data backup procedures should be included in a security plan. Data can be lost or damaged in
                            circumstances such as theft, equipment failure, or a disaster such as a fire or flood. Backing up
                            data is one of the most effective ways of protecting against data loss.</p>
                    </li>

            <h3>Following are some measures that you can take in order to minimize the risks associated with malicious human threats:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Data Storage in Safe Locations</b> Keep your data in safe and secure locations that have limited access to others. </li>
                    <li><b>Virus and Spyware Protection</b> You must open an e-mail attachment or install any software from a Web site with caution. The most reliable way is to install antivirus and anti-spyware software from a reputable vendor. </li>
                    <li><b>Human Errors</b> Many times, damage to a computer is due to unintentional human error. For example, you may accidentally delete an important file, causing the computer to malfunction.</li>
                    <li><b>Hardware Damage</b> Computer components, being delicate, run the risk of getting damaged due to carelessness.</li>
                    <li><b>Protecting hardware from accidental and environmental damages</b> You can take various measures to avoid any unintentional damage to your computer. Keep the computer in an area that is dust-free, free from vibration and out of the way of possible impact, should be well-ventilated to prevent any damage due to heat.</li> 
                    <li><b>Backing up Data</b> Regularly back up important computer data. Creating multiple copies of data provides protection against loss of data due to accidental erasure or destruction of data.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Review logs to identify security threats</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="cc">
                    <li>A log is a record of the events occurring within an organization's systems and networks.</li>  
                    <li>Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network. </li>
                    <li>Originally, logs were used primarily for troubleshooting problems, but logs now serve many functions within most organizations, such as optimizing system and network performance, recording the actions of users, and providing data useful for investigating malicious activity.</li> 
                    <li>Logs have evolved to contain information related to many different types of events occurring within networks and systems. </li>
                    <li>Within an organization, many logs contain records related to computer security; common examples of these computer security logs are audit logs that track user authentication attempts and security device logs that record possible attacks.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Common types of network-based and host based security software include the following: -</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Antimalware software</b>  The most common form of antimalware software is antivirus software,
                        which typically records all instances of detected malware, file and system disinfection attempts, 
                        and file quarantines.</li> 
                    <li><b>Intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems</b>  Intrusion detection and intrusion 
                        prevention systems record detailed information on suspicious behavior and detected attacks, as 
                        well as any actions intrusion prevention systems performed to stop malicious activity in progress. 
                        <br>Some intrusion detection systems, such as file integrity checking software, run periodically 
                        instead of continuously, so they generate log entries in batches instead of on an ongoing basis.</b> 
                    <li><b>Remote access software</b>  Often granted and secured through virtual private 
                        networking(VPN).  VPN systems typically log successful and failed login attempts, as well as 
                        the dates and times each user connected and disconnected, and the amount of data sent and 
                        received in each user session.</li>  
                    <li><b>Web proxies</b> Are intermediate hosts through which Web sites are accessed.  Web
                        proxies make Web page requests on behalf of users, and they cache copies of retrieved Web 
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Firewalls</b> It can permit or block activity based on a policy; however, firewalls use much more sophisticated methods to examine network traffic.6  Firewalls can also track the state of network traffic and perform content inspection. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Maintenance requirement may include but not limited to:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">

                    <li><b>Attention</b> 
                        <ul class="kb">
                            <li>Passive attention - refers to the involuntary process directed by external events that stand out
                                from their environment, such as a bright flash, a strong odor or a sudden loud noise. We might
                                say that because passive attention is involuntary, it is easy.</li>
                            <li>Active attention - is voluntary and is guided by alertness, concentration, interest and needs such
                                as curiosity and hunger.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Scheduling maintenance procedures</h3>
            <p>Maintenance schedule is a plan or procedures that are used to maintain equipment and it must
                be programmed with time of intervals. Maintenance schedules including removal of dust,
                grease build-up and etc...<br><b>Maintenance scheduling can be planed or prepared as:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Onsite response</b> Onsite response is one of maintenance schedule that display the plan or procedures from the
                        internet.</li>
                    <li><b>Remote diagnostics</b> refers to the ability to evaluate the current status of electronic equipment
                        from a remote location. The process involves the establishment of some type of wired or
                        wireless communication between the two points in order for the remote analysis to take place.
                        Remote diagnostics is the act of diagnosing a given symptom, issue or problem from a distance.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Use built-in tools</h3>
            <p>All operating systems come with utilities that are used for general checking, repair and reporting of faults. Each operating system is different but they do have some tools in common.
                Tools such as hard disk scanning, such as Scandisk from Microsoft
            </p>

            <h3>Device management tools</h3>
            <p>Most operating systems now work with the concept of "Plug and Play" devices. 
                This simply means that when a new device is installed, the system will automatically detect it and install the most appropriate software drivers for it. 
                A driver is a small piece of software written for a specific device. 
            </p>

            <h3>Maintenance of software</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Preventative maintenance to detect and correct code that may cause future errors (eg to validate input data).</li>
                    <li>Adaptive maintenance to adapt the software in line with changes to business requirements (eg to make it run on an Intranet).</li>
                    <li>Perfective maintenance to simply improve the performance of the software.</li>
                    <li>Reactive maintenance to fix software bugs.</li>
