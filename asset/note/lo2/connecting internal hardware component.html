        <p><b>Memory</b> consists of electronic components that store instructions waiting to be executed by the processor. Main memory including ROM and RAM.<br>
            <b>Read-only memory (ROM)</b>  stores basic instructions for booting the
            computer and loading the operating system.
            ROM chips retain their contents even when the computer is powered down. The contents
            <b>cannot be erased, changed, or rewritten by normal means.</b><br>
            <b>ROM types include the following:-</b>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>Programmable read-only memory(PROM):</b> Information is written to a PROM chip

                <li><b>Scanner:</b> An input device that can convert the contents of a paper document into a digital
                image that can be stored in the computer.</li>
                <li><b>CPU(Central Processing Unit) or the processor:</b> The "brain" of the computer where
                programs are run. It is one of the most expensive parts of the hardware. Modern CPUs
                can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.</li>
                <li><b>RAM(Random Access Memory):</b> The computer's high-speed, short-term memory. It
                temporarily stores data and instructions for programs that run on the computer.</li>
                <li><b>Expansion Cards:</b> Circuit boards that can be inserted to add functionality to a computer
                system (for example: network, sound, or video cards).</li>
                <li><b>Power Supply:</b> Converts electricity from the wall into the form that the other computer
                components use.</li>
                <li><b>Optical Drive:</b> An input or output device that reads data from and writes data to CDs and
                DVDs.</li>
                <li><b>Hard Drive:</b> A device that serves as the long-term storage memory of the
                computer. There are two primary kinds: mechanical drives that use a mechanical arm to
                read and write data on a rotating disk and "solid state" drives that have no moving parts.</li>
                <li><b>Motherboard:</b> A circuit board that holds and connects various components of the
                computer and allows their communication.</li>
                <li><b>Speaker:</b> An output device that outputs sound from the computer.</li>
                <li><b>Monitor:</b> An output device that displays information visually.</li>
                <li><b>Keyboard:</b> An input device on which the user can type to communicate with the
                computer.</li>
                <li><b>Mouse:</b> An input device that allows the user to interact with visual objects displayed on
                the monitor.</li>
                <li><b>External Hard Drive:</b> A device that serves as an extra hard drive used for
                additional or backup storage.</li>
                <li><b>Printer:</b> An output device that can transfer digital data onto paper.</li>
