                    <li>Formal title and document number</li>
                    <li>A detailed list of steps for performing the job or task</li>
                    <li>A complete list of tools and materials for doing the job</li>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the rules for writing standard maintenance procedures?</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>The burden of written communication is on the writer, not the reader. The goal is to
                        serve the user.</li>
                    <li>The first writing is a rough draft and will need to be reviewed and tried before being
                        published.</li>
                    <li>Use numbered line items and avoid paragraphs(one item per step).</li>
                    <li>Keep wording short and precise.</li>
                    <li>List steps in proper sequence. The job should flow in natural order.</li>
                    <li>Use step check-offs where useful.</li>
                    <li>Have the job performer enter quantitative values; it is even better than check-offs.</li>
                    <li>Target elementary-grade reading level(fourth or fifth grade) if possible, given the
                        nature of the procedure being written. A reading skill commensurate to the minimum
                        qualifications for performing the job itself is assumed.</li>
                    <li>Use graphics where needed to clarify meanings. A picture really is worth a thousand
                        words.</li>
                    <li>Keep verbiage consistent. Don't change equipment names from step to step.</li>
                    <li>If jobs involve too many steps, break the job into sections such as motor removal
                        section and gear unit removal section.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Service level agreement(SLA)</h3>
            <p>Service-level agreement(SLA) is a contract between a service provider and its internal or
                external customers that documents what services the provider will furnish and defines the
                service standards the provider is obligated to meet
            </p>

            <h3>Why are SLAs important?</h3>
            <p>Service providers need SLAs to help them manage customer expectations and define the circumstances under which they are not liable for outages or performance issues. Customers can also benefit from SLAs in that they describe the performance characteristics of the service, which can be compared with other vendors' SLAs, and also set forth the means for redressing service issues -- via service credits, for example. For a service provider, the SLA is typically one of two foundational agreements it has with customers. Many service providers establish a master services agreement to establish the general terms and conditions in which they will work with customers. The SLA is often incorporated by reference into the service provider's master services agreement. Between the two service contracts, the SLA adds greater specificity regarding the services provided and the metrics that will be used to measure their performance. </p>
            
            <h3>Preventive maintenance</h3>
            <p>Preventive maintenance is a regular and systematic inspection, cleaning, and replacement of
            worn parts, materials and systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Purpose of preventive maintenance</h3>
            <p>Reduce the likelihood of hardware or software problems by systematically and periodically checking hardware and software to ensure proper operation. Reduce computer down time and repair costs.</p>

                            is not essential for operations or has a low cost (think anything that's rarely used or duplicates

                        <b>Preventive maintenance(scheduled)</b>
                        <p>Also known as proactive maintenance, this method involves periodically taking assets offline
                            and inspecting or repairing them at predetermined intervals (usually time or event-based
                            triggers). The goal of this approach is to extend the useful life of an asset and prevent
                            breakdowns from occurring. In preventive maintenance all thing done before the equipment fail.</p>

                        <b>Predictive maintenance (PdM)</b>
                        <p>Predictive maintenance(PdM) aims to predict failures before they happen so maintenance can
                            occur at just the right time. PdM uses data from machine sensors and smart technology to alert
                            the maintenance team when a piece of equipment is at risk of failing. For example, a sensor may
                            use vibration analysis to alert the maintenance team that a piece of equipment is at risk of failing,
                            at which point it will be taken offline, inspected, and repaired accordingly.</p>

                        <b>Reliability-centered maintenance(RCM)</b>
                        <p>Reliability-centered maintenance(RCM) addresses the fact that failure is not always linear.
                            RCM is a highly-involved process that seeks to analyse all the possible failure modes for each
                            piece of equipment and customize a maintenance plan for each individual machine. The ultimate
                            goal of RCM is to increase equipment availability or reliability</p>
