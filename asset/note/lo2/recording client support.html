            <h2>Unit 1: Log request for support</h2>
            <h3>Record client support requirements</h3>
            <p>Information technology is an integral part of the operation of modern organizations. Users of
                information technology need timely, high-quality support. These readings cover some of the
                skills and knowledge that you will need in order to provide that support. In addition to sound
                technical skills, IT support staff should have a range of skills that improve their ability to
                successfully provide IT services to their clients.</p>
            <h3>Definition of terms</h3>
            <p><b>Client</b> can be an individual, an organization, business or an institution that may come in
                person or communicate using any communication means like telephone, e-mail, fax or online
                help desk to get technical support, consultation on technologies etc...</p>
            <p><b>Log</b>  means recording client support requirements based on organizational rule,
                regulation and policies.</p>
            <p><b>Escalate</b> transferring a help desk that cannot be resolved to personnel at a lower
                level such as an IT specialist or IT manager. Escalate means relocating a problem to higher level IT technician.</p>
            <p><b>First level Support</b> usually refers to the initial support offered to a customer by a
                help desk operator; in this initial point of contact, the officer determines the nature of
                the call and will try to solve the problem if it is straightforward; support organizations
                usually have quite clear outlines of what constitutes first level support.
            </p>
            <p><b>Priority</b> the value given to an incident, problem or change to indicate its relative
                importance in order to appropriately allocate resources and specify an appropriate
                time-frame for resolution.</p>
            <p><b>Service level agreement</b> an agreement between a service provider and a customer
                detailing the level of service that is provided, usually including what is covered, what
                is not covered, the response time for resolution.</p>

            <h3>SLA(Service Level Agreement)</h3>
            <p>This is a contract that defines expectations between an organization and the service
                seller to provide an agreed-upon level of support.</p>
            <h3>Some of the contents of an SLA usually include the following:-</h3>

                    <li>Where service will be provided</li>
                    <li>Preventive maintenance</li>
                    <li>Diagnostics</li>
                    <li>Part availability</li>
                    <li>Cost and penalties</li>
                    <li>Time of service availability</li>

            <h3>Clients
                with IT problems report these to the help desk support is typically provided for areas such as:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Hardware and software faults</li>
                    <li>Networking problems</li>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>First level support</h3>
            <p><b>Clients may request support:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>By calling a telephone or by email</li>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Escalating a call</h3>
            <p>If a help desk operator cannot immediately solve a problem, it will be passed to a member of the
                technical support staff.
                <b>For example you may receive requests from clients that:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Are too complex or outside your expertise</li>
                    <li>Require a software upgrade to be done by a support officer</li>
                    <li>Require a system modification that would need to be done by an analyst/programmer</li>
                    <li>Require a change to the database requiring the skills of the database administrator.</li>
                </ul>

                <b>In such cases the help desk staff will do:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Apply a priority rating to the call</li>
                    <li>Escalate the call to an appropriate support person</li>
                    <li>Provide the client with a reference number for the job and an idea of when the problem
                        will be solved based on the initial priority</li>
                    <li>Record the referral details</li>
                </ul>

                <b>For call escalation to be effective you will need well-trained and
                    adequate support staff who:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Respond quickly to calls</li>
                    <li>Know when to escalate a call to an IT specialist</li>
                    <li>Know to which IT specialist escalate the call</li>
                    <li>Coordinate follow-up with the user</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Document the client requirements and report</h3>
            <p>After analysis of the client requirements, you should fully document the client requirements
                and report them to your supervisor.
                <b>This document include the following:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Background information such as company details</li>
                    <li>Problems and issues that may have lead to the client request</li>
                    <li>Questions asked during your meeting with the client and their answers to those
                        questions as well as a list of any essential criteria</li>
                    <li>Other options or possibilities of which the client may not have been aware</li>
                    <li>Any information for the client that will help them understand what they are getting
                        into before you go ahead with the job or project.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Reviewing client support history</h3>
            <p>Reviewing client support history means checking the client support request database for the same
                problems.</p>
            <h3>Important of reviewing client support history</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>It enables to find easily how the previously logged problem is solved</li>
                    <li>It eliminates redundancy of recording the same problem</li>
                    <li>It enables easily identify the problems solved from the one in queue</li>
                    <li>It enables the responsible IT staff for the resolution of the problems logged etc...</li>

            <h3></h3>
            <p>Listening to the client
                When you are dealing with clients and colleagues, it's vital that you listen carefully and respond
                appropriately. To do this, people often use the active listening technique.
                <b>Active listening</b> occurs when you focus on the message you are receiving from the other person,
                without thinking about what you want to say next. <br>
                <b>You can often tell if someone is really listening to you if they are:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Smiling</li>
                    <li>Nodding</li>
                    <li>Staying silent</li>
                    <li>Making eye contact</li>
                    <li>Using a friendly and interested tone of voice</li>
                    <li>Encouraging you to continue</li>
                    <li>Asking open questions</li>
                    <li>Reflecting how you the speaker are feeling</li>
                    <li>Leaning towards you the speaker</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Confirming client requirements</h3>
            <p>Confirming the client requirements involves developing documentation to ensure you and the
                client have the same understanding of requirements. This documentation may be based on preexisting documents that can be used as a template. </p>

            <h3>Obtaining approval</h3>
            <p>Obtaining approval might occur in a number of ways. It might be a verbal approval to go ahead
                with work based on the confirmation document. As mentioned earlier, you should never rely on
                a verbal approval. Memories of events can differ very much and lead to confusion and conflict
                later.One way of obtaining approval is to have the client provide a written purchase order for the
                work. Alternatively, the client might write a letter outlining their agreement to your requirements
                document, asking you to go ahead with the work.
                <b>Any approval document that is produced should include agreement on:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>The standard of the goods or services to be provided</li>
                    <li>The price of the goods or services to be provided</li>
                    <li>The timelines for the project (either broken down into timelines for specific tasks or for
                        the entire project)</li>
                    <li>Any ongoing or follow up services required or foreseen.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Recommending appropriate training and support</h3>
            <p><b>The technical support identified with the client might include areas such as:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Installation</li>
                    <li>Troubleshooting</li>

                organization.</p>
            
            <h3>Methods of gathering additional information</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Interviews:</b> collecting information verbally from informants, using a question and
                        answer format.</li>
                    <li><b>Surveys or questionnaires:</b> collecting information from respondents without direct
                        contact. Paper versions of a survey may be handed out or mailed. You might also
                        ask people to complete surveys electronically via email or internet.</li>
                    <li><b>Focus groups:</b> conducting group interviews with a small group of participants or
                        other informants at the same time.</li>
                    <li><b>Observation:</b> recording what actually happens during a situation or event.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Two main types of sources in the field of information gathering:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Existing sources:</b> are those sources of information that can be
                        found in the printed, in video, in audio and other materials that are available to
                        the public or upon request to proper bureaucracy.</li>
                    <li><b>Natural sources:</b> are first hand sources such as those who
                        have tried products, services and methods and expressing their experience and
                        opinions to the information collector.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Records</h3>
            <p><b>Records</b> are information created, received and maintained as evidence and information by an
                organization or person.<br><b>Information</b> is data, ideas, thoughts, or memories irrespective of medium. Information sources are
                considered non-records, they are useful but do not provide evidence.<br><b>Documents</b> are any recorded
                information or objects that can be treated as individual units.
            </p>

            <h3>Why are records important?</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>We can find any history of the document and use it again easily</li>
                    <li>To prevent unaccepted problems</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Benefits of effective records management include:-</h3>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>There are three main ways of storing information:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Manual filing system:</b> means one in which papers or written communication is stored by hand
                        in filing cabinet in folders on shelves in the box files etc...</li>
                    <li><b>Microfilm filing system:</b> is the filing of documents that have been photographed, developed on film in
                        greatly reduced size and printed on plastic strips or cards.
                        <ul class="kb">
                            <li>
                                <b>Centralized filing </b>
                                <p>All the files for the whole organization are stored in one place, which
                                    is usually manned by specialized staff.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Departmental filing</b>
                                <p>Each department has its own files which everyone in that department
                                    has access to.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Vertical filing</b>
                                <p>This method is the most popular way of filing. The files are suspended in upright position in
                                    drawers of metal filing cabinets.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Lateral filing</b>
                                <p>With this files are suspended from rails in horizontal rows on racks or shelves, rather like
                                    books on a bookshelf. Where space is limited lateral filing is a good idea, as there are no
                                    filing drawers to open and the shelves or racks can be right up to the ceiling if necessary.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>An electronics or computerized system</b> enables documents to be filed on computer storage medium. CDs,
                        Flash discs, memory cards are some of the devices used in electronic system of filing.
                    </li>
