                    <li><b>Resource allocation</b> ensures the proper use of all the resources
                        available by deciding which resource to be used by whom for how much time.</li>
                    <li><b>Accounting</b> The Operating System tracks an account of all the functionalities taking place in
                        the computer system at a time.</li>
                    <li><b>Information and resource protection</b> the Operating System is responsible for using all the

                    <li>The users of a batch operating system do not interact with the computer directly.</li>
                    <li>Each user
                        prepares his job on an off-line device like punch cards and submits it to the computer operator. </li>
                    <li>Lack of interaction between the user and the job.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Real-Time operating system</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>The time taken by the
                        system to respond to an input and display of required updated information is termed as the
                        response time.</li>
                    <li>Real-time operating system must have well-defined, fixed time
                        constraints, otherwise the system will fail.</li>
                    <li><b>There are two types of real-time
                        operating systems:-</b>
                        <ul class="listno">
                            <li><b>Hard real-time systems</b> guarantee that critical tasks complete on time. In hard real-time systems,
                                secondary storage is limited or missing and the data is stored in ROM. In these systems, virtual
                                memory is almost never found.</li>
                            <li><b>Soft real-time systems</b> are less restrictive. A critical real-time task gets priority over other tasks
                                and retains the priority until it completes. Soft real-time systems have limited utility than hard
                                real-time systems.</li>

            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Microsoft Windows:</b> Windows comes pre-loaded
                        on most new PCs, which helps to make it the most popular operating system in the world.There have been many
                        different versions of Windows, but the most recent ones are Windows 11.</li>
                    <li><b>Mac OS:</b> previously called OS X is a line of operating systems created by Apple. It comes
                        preloaded on all Macintosh computers, or Macs.</li>
                    <li><b>Linux:</b> pronounced LINN-ux is a family of open-source operating systems and command line interface operating system, which means they
                        can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world.The
                        advantages of Linux are that it is free.</li>
                    <br>Mac OS users account for less than 10% of global
                    operating systems much lower than the percentage of Windows users (more than 80%). One
                    reason for this is that Apple computers tend to be more expensive. However, many people do
                    prefer the look and feel of macOS over Windows.Linux users account for less than 2% of global
                    operating systems. However, most servers run Linux because it's relatively easy to customize.

            <h3>Operating system installation process and components</h3>
            <p><b>List of boot methods:-</b>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>CD-ROM</b></li>
                    <li><b>DVD</b></li>
                    <li><b>USB</b></li>
                    <li><b>PXE</b> The Pre boot Execution Environment is a capability that is present in most computers
                        which allows for automatic installation of an operating system whose files are on a network
                        drive. <b>In this case, physical media is not required.</b></li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Type of installations</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Unattended installation:</b> this is a type of installation where the user must not be present
                        so as to respond to the numerous prompts that come during the installation.</li>
                    <li><b>Upgrade:</b>  a type of installation where the installation begins with the
                        presence of the previous operating system.</li>
                    <li><b>Clean installation:</b> is erasing of every file in the computer.</li>
                    <li><b>Repair installation:</b> is use when the operating system files are corrupted or damaged.</li>
                    <li><b>Multi boot:</b> at times, one may desire to install a new operating system version without
                        having to do away with the old or existing operating system. In such a case, one should be in a
                        position to support a Multi boot configuration also known as dual boot configuration.</li>
                    <li><b>Remote network installation</b> this especially comes into place where physical media is not required during
                        the installation. One should put all one's windows installation files and configurations in a
                        network drive.</li>
                    <li><b>Image deployment:</b> this simply involves cloning the particular OS image to another PC if
                        there is need for the machine to be deployed.</li>
                    <li><b>Creating image:</b> One should know that this task basically requires the installer to come up
                        with a windows operating system that is a cloned by taking an existing OS version and make
                        sector copies of everything on the computer.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Partitioning</h3>
            <p>Hard drive partitioning is a prompt that one should come across when installing any windows
                operating system especially if it is a first time installation. Presently, most of the available
                computers run a Master Boot Record Partition Table which supports four partitions on one hard
                disk. The newer Globally Unique Identifier partition table supports 128 partitions.
                <br><b>Types of hard drive partitions</b>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Dynamic:</b> A dynamic disk partition is one that has the capability to deny addition of any new
                        drive in addition to spanning of data from the basic partition into the newly installed drive.
                        This dynamic disk partition can be supported by several Windows operating systems.</li>
                    <li><b>Basic:</b> A basic disk partition is an idea of Microsoft. This either has a Disk Operating System
                        or Windows installed on it. It can bear primary and logical partitions with logical drives also
                        inclusive.</li>
                    <li><b>Primary:</b> A primary partition is basically a partition that one's operating system can boot
                        from. A primary partition allows performance of Multi boot capability where one of the
                        partitions is designed as the active partition which automatically launches once the computer
                        is powered on.</li>
                    <li><b>Extended:</b> Extended partitions come into use when one wants to have more than four
                        partitions in a disk. One can also create more partitions on the extended partition. Extended
                        partitions are not as flexible as primary partitions since one can't boot from them.</li>
                    <li><b>Logical:</b> Logical partitions are basically partitions that are created inside of an extended
                        partition. An OS cannot boot from such partitions.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><b>FAT:</b> File Allocation Table was among the pioneer file systems for personal computers which
                        have been on constant update throughout years.</li>
                    <li><b>FAT32:</b> is considered an update or rather advancement of the FAT. It began with Windows
                        2000 and now in all later versions. It allowed for one to have volume sizes of almost two
                        terabytes with files of a four gigabytes maximum size.</li>
                    <li><b>CDFS:</b> The Compact Disk File System is one that is present in operating systems that allow
                        the reading of compact disks or DVD-ROMS. It can be used on Microsoft windows, UNIX,
                        Linux and Macintosh systems being an ISO standard number 9660. It simplifies the task of
                        writing information on a CD.</li>
                    <li><b>NTFS:</b> is a file system type that has more improvements compared to FAT32. This file
                        system allows for file compression and encryption utilities without having to use specific
                        software. It is a utility built to function with the file system and operate with the OS. It also
                        has data recovery features and additional security in addition to many improvements
                        regarding this file system. It has many versions with version 1.0 being the first.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Quick formatting VS Full Formatting</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Quick formatting</b> is a specific type of formatting that occurs very fast. It generally erases data
                from the drive, <b>formats it with the specified file system without going through the drive to check
                for bad errors.</b><br>
                <b>Full formatting</b>  on the other hand involves putting on the new file system meaning that it wipes data
                and puts the file system in place. <b>This one goes through all sectors in
                the entire storage device.</b>
            </p>

            <h3>Operating System licensing</h3>
            <p>An Operating System license is almost like a proof of purchase. Operating System licenses are
                sometimes called an <b>OS License Key</b>. After entering a valid OS license that you purchased,
                you will be able to use the OS without any limitations thereafter.</p>

                    <li><b>Graphical user interface(GUI)</b> is through a user friendly rather than having users directly enter commands via a command-line
                        interface, a GUI allows provides a mouse-based window-and-menu system as an interface.</li>

                        system and particular devices to communicate. So, it is necessary to update device.</li>
                    <li><b>Uninstall Programs you never use:</b> Reclaim the hard disk space by uninstalling the programs which are not in use for a long time.
                        To reclaim your memory on the hard disk.</li>
                    <li><b>Check for Viruses and Spyware</b> Virus and spyware can not only slow down your device but even can corrupt your data and do
                    identity theft. So, it’s better to scan for viruses and spyware to remove.</li>
                    <li><b>Disk Clean-up:</b> is a computer maintenance utility tool used to remove temporary files, files in the
                    recycle bin and other items that you no longer need.</li>
                    <li><b>Optimize your Hard Drive:</b> Fragmentation occurs when the allotted memory is larger than the memory requested by the
                        program, then the difference between allotted and requested memory is known as fragmentation.
                        So, we need to run a disk defragmenter to rearrange fragmentation which makes drives work
                        more efficiently</li>
                    <li><b>Adjust for Best Performance</b> Lowering or customizing the settings of Windows visual effects will increase the performance of
                        your devices.</li>
                    <li><b>Turn off Transparency Effects:</b> Transparency effects will make your Windows device slow as it consumes resources. You can
                        disable transparency to reclaim that resources.</li>
                    <li><b>Disable Background Apps</b> There may be some bloatware (pre-installed applications) on your Windows device which runs
                        in the background even if you are using them. You can even disable the background applications.</li>
                    <li><b>Limit Start-up programs:</b> Start-up programs are the programs that are configured to start when you log in. In most cases,
                        apps will start minimized or may only start in background tasks.</li>
                    <li><b>Change the size of Virtual Memory:</b> A paging file is an area on the hard disk that Window uses as if it were RAM. We can adjust this
                        paging file size to improve window performance.</li>
                    <li><b>Close running applications that are not in use:</b>
                        Every running application consumes resources like CPU and memory. So, it is necessary to close
                        all the application which is not used to reclaim the allocated resources.</li>
                    <li><b>Turn Off Tips and Notifications</b> We can also stop some background services that provide tips and suggestions to use Windows.</li>
                    <li><b>Improve Hardware</b> To improve the performance of Windows PC we can also upgrade the hardware. Adding better
                        technology hardware will definitely improve the read and write speed of your device.</li>
