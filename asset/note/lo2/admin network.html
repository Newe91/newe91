                                        Optical fiber is the technology associated with data transmission using light pulses travelling
                                        along with a long fiber which is usually made of plastic or glass. Metal wires are preferred for
                                        transmission in optical fiber communication as signals travel with fewer damages. Optical fibers
                                        are also unaffected by electromagnetic interference. The fiber optical cable uses the application
                                        of total internal reflection of light. An optical fiber consists of an extremely thin cylinder of
                                        glass, called the core, surrounded by a concentric layer of glass, known as the cladding. The
                                        fibers are sometimes made of plastic. Plastic is easier to install, but cannot carry the light pulses
                                        for as long a distance as glass.<br>
                                        The basic function of any optical fiber is to guide light, i.e., to act as a dielectric waveguide.
                                        Light injected into one end should stay guided in the fiber.

                        <b>Hub</b>
                        <p>A network hub is a node that broadcasts data to every computer or Ethernet-based device
                            connected to it. A hub is less sophisticated than a switch, the latter of which can isolate data
                            transmissions to specific devices. Network hubs are best suited for small, simple local area
                            network (LAN) environments.</p>

                            A switch is the upgraded version of the bridge. Besides providing all the functionalities of a
                            bridge, it also offers several additional features.
                            The biggest advantage of a switch is that it makes switching decisions in hardware by using
                            application-specific integrated circuits(ASICs).</p>

                            A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers
                            perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet.

                            two different types of network layer protocols such as TCP/IP or IPX. It requires the same

                            network. The gateway device knows the path to the remote destination address. If necessary, it
                            also encapsulates the packet so that it can travel through other networks to reach its destination

                Maintaining your computer network is important because there are many factors that can go
                wrong on a daily basis. Regular maintenance can keep the big problems away, while helping to

            <p>Maintenance schedules allow you to temporarily disable monitoring on specific resources

                machines. When the scheduled maintenance is completed, ipMonitor reactivates the
                affected monitors. This process ensures that your planned maintenance activities do not
                trigger alerts or negative results in your historic reports.

            <h3>Things to maintain and repair computer system and network</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Back up your data</li>
                    <li>Clean dust from your computer</li>
                    <li> Clean up your cabling and everything else too</li>
                    <li>Organize your installation disks</li>
                    <li>Run antivirus and spyware and scans regularly</li>

            <h3>The difference between command line interface(CLI) and graphical user interface(GUI)</h3>
            <p><b>Command line interface(CLI)</b> is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage
                computer files and interact with the computer. Command line interface(CLI) allows the user to interact with the system using commands. <b>CLI</b> is also called Command Language Interpreter,
                Console User Interface or Character User Interface. It allows the users to enter commands to
                the terminal to perform the task.<br>
                <b>Windows command line tools</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>CMD</li>
                    <li>PowerShell</li>
                    <li>ConEmu</li>
                    <li>PSReadLine</li>
                    <li>Chocolatey and etc...</li>
                </ul>
                <br><b>Graphical user interface(GUI)</b> it takes the advantage of computer graphics. It allows
                the user to interact with the computer using components such as windows, icons, labels, text
                boxes, and radio buttons. It is easy for the user to perform tasks using GUI as it does not require
                remembering commands. He can easily click on icons, drag and drop objects using the mouse.
                <br>CLI is faster then GUI but GUI is more flexible whereas CLI is not much flexible.

            <h3>Why do we maintain computer hardware?</h3>
            <p>Keeping computers well maintained can prevent viruses and malware, and keep your computer
                in good working order. Regular maintenance ensures that your antivirus software is kept up to
                date and working properly. Nothing could be more annoying than a computer running too
                slowly.</p>

            <h3>What is the first step to performing hardware maintenance?</h3>
            <p>Turn off the computer and remove its power source.</p>

            <h3>How do you clean computer parts and peripherals?</h3>
            <p>Use an anti-static cloth to lightly dust your computer casing. Do not use furniture cleaners or
                strong solvents. Use a can of compressed air to blow out debris from the air intake slots.
                Ammonia diluted with water—or glass cleaner comprised mostly of ammonia and water—is a
                safe cleaning solution for computer surfaces.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of maintenance</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Preventive</b>
                        <p>In preventive maintenance, equipment is repaired and serviced before failures occur. The
                            frequency of maintenance activities is pre-determined by schedules. Preventive maintenance
                            aims to eliminate unnecessary inspection and maintenance tasks, to implement additional
                            maintenance tasks when and where needed and to focus efforts on the most critical items.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Predictive</b>
                        <p>Predictive maintenance (PdM) is a type of condition-based maintenance that monitors the
                            condition of assets through sensor devices. These sensor devices supply data in real-time, which
                            is then used to predict when the asset will require maintenance and thus, prevent equipment
                            failure.
                            <br>Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service
                            equipment in order to estimate when maintenance should be performed. This approach promises
                            cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed
                            only when warranted.
                            <br>Predictive maintenance refers to maintenance based on the actual condition of a component.<br>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Corrective</b>
                        <p>Corrective maintenance refers to action only taken when a system or component failure has
                            occurred. It is thus a retro-active strategy. The task of the maintenance team in this scenario is
                            usually to effect repairs as soon as possible.</p>
                    </li>

            <h3>What causes a hardware failure?</h3>
            <p>Harsh environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures can damage hardware
                components. Unregulated power supply of any sort can damage hardware components. This
                includes power surges from the regular power line or from lightning.
