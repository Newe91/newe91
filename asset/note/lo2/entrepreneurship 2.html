            </p>

            <h3>Here are some points to remember</h3>

                    <li>Break-even analysis helps with decisions regarding pricing and production levels.</li>
                    <li>Pricing can be done on the basis of 'Cost Plus' thinking and this ensures a minimum margin over costs.</li>
                    <li>Market considerations are important in pricing and are taken into account by pricing at 'What the market can bear'.</li>
                    <li>The price fixed lies within this range of possibilities. Therefore, it is important that groups calculate the costs and have an understanding of the final market for their products.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                    <li><b>Profit</b> = Total revenue - Total costs</li>
                    <li><b>Profit margin</b> = Total revenue - Total costs of article
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Fundamental accounting equation</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Asset</b> = Liability + Owners Equity</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Marketing philosophy</h3>
            <p>Marketing philosophy is the strategy that firms implement to satisfy customers needs, increase sales, maximize profit and beat the competition. Marketing philosophy is one of the simplest ideas in marketing and at the same time it is also one of the most important marketing philosophies.Its very core important for customer and his or her satisfaction. And states that the organization should strive to satisfy its customers wants and needs while meeting the organization goals as well as society interest at different relative weights. As we know the customer is king. Marketing management wants to design strategies that will engage target customers adn build profitable relationships with them. But what philosophy should guide these marketing strategies? What weight should be given to the interests of customers, the organization and society?</p>
            <h3>Importance of marketing philosophy</h3>
            <p>Marketing is about the process of creating,communicating and delivering products to customers to satisfy their needs profitably. The marketing philosophy underlines how the company achieves this. It is about the way of doing business. It's not just the domain of the marketing department. Its application affects processes and activities throughout the organization, requiring synergies between the marketing department and other departments such as operations,finance and human resources.</p>
            <h3>Types of marketing philosophies/concept</h3>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>Production concept</b>
                    <p>The production concept holds that consumers will favor products that are available and highly affordable or cheap. Therefor management should focus on improving production and distribution efficiency. The concept is one of the oldest orientations that guide sellers.<br>
                    The production concept is still a useful philosophy in some situations but companies adopting this orientation run a major risk of focusing too narrowly on their own operations and losing sight of the real objective satisfying customer needs and building customer relationships.Most times the production concept can lead to marketing myopia. Management focuses on improving production and distribution efficiency.<br>
                    If a firm decides to operate based on this concept it will try to minimize production costs by making the production process efficient. Moreover; for its products to be favoured by the consumers it will tr t  make its distribution as extensive as possible.
                    <br><b>This production concept is found to be applicable if two situations prevail such as:-</b>
                        <ul class="listno">
                            <li><b>When the demand for a product exceeds supply</b> This is seen in markets that are highly price-sensitive and budget-conscious. Under such situations, consumers will basically be interested in owning the product, not the quality or features of it. Thus; producers will be interested in increasing their outputs.</li>
                            <li><b>If the production costs are very high, that discourages consumers from buying the product</b> The company puts allof its efforts in to building production volume and improving technology to bring down costs.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <b>Production concept example:-</b> In amazon or retail stores; the market is flooded with cheap products from china. Everything from the cheap plastic product from china is on your cart now.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Product concept</b>
                    <p>The product concept holds that consumers will favor products that offer the most in quality, performance and innovative features. The main emphasis here is on the product. Therefore; it is understood that in the product concept, the management fails to identify what business it is in, which leads to the marketing myopia.
                    <br><b>Product concept example:-</b> Suppose a company makes the best quality floppy disk. But a customer does need a floppy disk? She or he needs something that can be used store the data. It can be achieved by a USB flash drive, SD memory cards, portable hard disks and etc... So that the company should not look to make the best floppy disk, they should focus on meeting the customers data storage needs.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Selling concept</b>
                    <p>Selling concept holds that consumers will not buy enough of the firms products unless it undertakes a large-scale selling and promotion efforts. The concept proposes that customers be individual or organizations will not buy enough of  the organizations products unless they are persuaded to do so through selling efforts <b>Such as aggressive selling</b> however carries high risks. It focuses on creating sales transactions rather than on building long-term profitable customer relationships. The aim often is to sell what the company makes rather than to make what the market wants.
                    <br><b>Selling concept example:-</b> Every saw an ad online or Tv commercial that you almost can't escape and hide from? The selling concept is in play. Almost all soft drinks and soda drinks follow the selling concept.  
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Marketing concept</b>
                    <p>The marketing concept holds that achieving organizational goals depends on knowing the needs and wants of target markets and delivering the desired satisfactions better than competitors do. Here marketing management takes a "customer first" approach. Under the marketing concept customer focus and value are the routes to achieve sales and profits. Instead of a product centered make and sell philosophy. The marketing concept is a <b>customer-centered sense and respond philosophy.</b> The job is not to find the right customers for your product but to find the right products for your customers.<br>
                    According to philip kotler the marketing concept holds that the key to achieving organizational determining and satisfying the needs and wants of target markets or determining the needs and wants of target markets and delivering the desired satisfactions more effectively and efficiently than competitors.
                    <br><b>The marketing concept is based on four main pillars such as:-</b>
                    <ul class="listno">
                        <li><b>Market focus</b> The marketing concept suggests that a company should focus its attention on marketing rather than production and selling.</li>
                        <li><b>Customer orientation</b> Focusing on a particular market does not guarantee a company success in the marketplace. What is needed for success is customer orientation. Customer orientation is important in the sense that a company future and progress depend on the customers.</li>
                        <li><b>Coordinated marketing</b> The marketing concept is a total enterprise concept. To be successful all marketing functions must be coordinated among themselves and second marketing itself must be well-coordinated with other departments. A company managed under the marketing concept must plan, organize, coordinate and control its entire operation as one system directed toward achieving a single set of objectives applicable to the total organization to eliminate conflicts and to ensure team spirit.</li>
                        <li><b>Profitability</b> The end tof the marketing concept is to make profits through customer satisfaction.</li>
