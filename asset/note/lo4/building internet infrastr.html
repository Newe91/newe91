            <h2>Plan and design internet infrastructure</h2>
            <h3>What is internet infrastructure?</h3>
            <p>Internet infrastructure is a collective term for all hardware and software systems that
                constitute essential components in the operation of the internet.<br>
                <b> Internet Infrastructure consisting of:-</b>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Data center</b>  is a centralized computer facility storehouse used to address computer
                        systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage
                        systems.</li>
                    <li><b>Network</b> without a
                        network connection no data can pass between Data Centers and/or Workstations,
                        over the internet.</li>
                    <li><b>Internet Service Provider(ISP)</b>  is a company that provides internet access for homes and businesses.</li>
                    <li><b>Computer equipment</b> refers to any or all of the many different parts of a computer, as
                        well as peripheral devices such as printers, external hard drives and servers.</li>
                    <li><b>Server applications</b> in order for a web application to be delivered from a server, that server requires such as hardware and software server.</li>
                    <li><b>Internet security</b>
                        <p>
                            <ul class="kb">
                                <li><b>Management controls:</b> focus on security policies, planning, guidelines and standards that influence the
                                    selection of operational and technical controls to protect the organization.</li>
                                <li><b>Technical controls:</b> it involve the correct use of hardware and software security capabilities in systems. Such task include <b>Login, encryption,authentication protocol,access control.firewall/proxy server and interruption detection system</b></li>
                                <li><b>Operational controls:</b> address the correct implementation and use of security policies and standards,
                                    ensuring consistency in security operations and correcting identified operational
                                    shortage.
                                    <br>These controls relate to mechanisms and procedures that are primarily implemented
                                    by people rather than systems. Such task include <b>Backup/Restore, monitor audit trials, account/privilege management, monitoring firewall,media disposal and etc...</b></li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Types of requirements</h2>
            <h3>1. Non-functional requirements</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>How the system is to be constructed and function.</li>
                    <li>Often one of the first steps in large projects is to develop a functional specification, also
                        known as the functional requirements specification(FRS).</li>
                    <li>After this, a technical specification can be produced.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>2. Functional requirements</h3>
            <p>Functional requirements <b>are capture the intended behavior of the system.</b> This behavior may
                be expressed as services, tasks or functions the system is required to perform.
                The functional requirements documents <b>are the blueprint for the project.</b><br> <b>Functional requirements may include identifying or clarifying:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>The business case</b>
                    <li>What the client considers the project main objectives</li>
                    <li>What IT infrastructure is already in place</li>
                    <li>Conflicting or overlapping requirements</li>
                    <li>Maintenance and backup requirements</li>
                    <li>Bandwidth issues that may affect the project</li>
                    <li>The nature of the data</li>
                    <li>Security needs</li>
                    <li>Available support resources</li>
                    <li>Costing</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>For most IT applications including multimedia, the needs analysis will need to focus on
                three perspectives:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Business perspective</b> an outline of the current business climate, structure of company and the
                        emerging industry issues that are driving the project.</li>
                    <li><b>Technical perspective</b> an outline of existing IT systems/infrastructure of the company including
                        computer hardware specifications, numbers and locations, details on
                        browsers, operating systems, servers, security policies, networks, bandwidth
                        capacity and so on.</li>
                    <li><b>Human perspective</b> an outline of the motivation of staff to use new IT systems.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Scope documentation</h3>
            <p>Scope documentation refers to the formal documentation that outlines the requirements and parameters of a project. It includes details about the product scope (what the project will produce) and the project scope (the work required to create the product). <b>The aim of the scope document is to identify, control and justify the proposed solution.</b> </p>

            <h3>Functional requirements specification</h3>
            <p>The functional specification describes what the system will do, as opposed to how it will
                be done.  The language of the functional specification should be clear, concise and non-technical.
                <br><b>Important of functional requirements specification</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>The client may not be interested in the details of how a function is implemented, and
                        the technical details may simply cause confusion for the client
                        ïƒ¼ the implementation details may need to change during the design and development of
                        the project.</li>
                    <li>You don't want to have to negotiate changes to the functional specification just to
                        change details of implementation.</li>
                    <li>The technical specification for large projects will be detailed in a separate document,
                        and you should not entangle one with the other.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Use case</h3>
            <p>Use case is a list of steps, typically defining
                interactions between a role and a system, to
                achieve a goal. Use cases allow the designer to focus on
                details, but keep the design grounded in the
                basics of how the system will be used. </p>

            <h2>List of functional requirements</h2>

            <h3>1. User requirements</h3>

                    <li>What does management expect the system will do and won't do?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>3. Hardware requirements</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Compatibility</li>
                    <li>Will the existing systems and architecture support all
                        types of media?</li>
                    <li>Will the new system be supported by existing resources within the company?</li>

                    <li>Are there other projects that you may be able to share hardware costs with? and etc...</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>4. Software requirements</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>What is the true cost of the software?</li>
                    <li>Are there licensing issues?</li>

            </p>

            <h3>Support materials</h3>
            <p>You will need to consider the content and design requirements of all support materials.
                <br><b>Support materials could include:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>System specifications</li>
                    <li>User guides</li>
                    <li>Knowledge banks</li>
                    <li>Internet help sites/CD-ROMs</li>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Role definitions</h3>
            <p>One of the most important tasks a developer must do before moving into the design and
                development phases is to clarify roles and responsibilities.
                <br><b>For example; the main things to clarify in terms of roles and responsibilities may include:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Who is responsible for the sign-off?</li>
                    <li>Should the roles be described as position titles rather than individuals names?</li>
                    <li>Who approves purchases?</li>
                    <li>Who will support the project after the development team has gone?</li>
                    <li>Who will collect and collate the content?</li>
                    <li>Who will check the legality of the content?</li>
                    <li>Who has responsibility for organizing the workspace for the development team?</li>
                    <li>Who will approve the security systems of the multimedia product?
                    <li>Who takes final responsibility for the project?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Budget issues</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Funding is a tricky area. Sometimes the 'real' budget is not disclosed. Sometimes this is
                        done for valid reasons, sometimes not.</li>
                    <li>It is common knowledge that some clients are reluctant to reveal their budget as vendors
                        will bid up to available funds.</li>
                    <li>some parts of the IT industry are still somewhat immature, so it is often difficult
                        to cost a job.</li>
                    <li>There are many variables. One job could take 2-3 weeks to install and set-up. Once all the
                        bugs are identified, the task might only take a matter of hours to repeat.</li>
                    <li>Implementing complex IT projects is not an exact science.</li>
                    <li>Due to this situation, it's always worthwhile to seek additional funds.</li>
                    <li>Many large and small organizations do not appreciate being asked to fund extra amounts
                        after a project has commenced.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Sign-off</h3>
            <p>In the planning phase, the sign-off typically covers an agreement with the client for the
                following items:-
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Target platforms</li>
                    <li>Look and feel of the solution proposed product/system</li>
                    <li>Graphics standards</li>
                    <li>Navigation and user issues</li>
                    <li>Hardware and Software limitations</li>
                    <li>Development tools</li>
                    <li>Client and developer responsibilities</li>
                    <li>Privacy issues</li>
                    <li>Initial timelines</li>
                    <li>Budget</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Ethernet</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">

                    <li>Ethernet speeds have been slowly increasing over the last decade, from 10 megabits per
                        second (10 Mbps, 10 million bps) up to discussions of 10 gigabits per second (10 Gbps, 10
                        x 1000 Mbps) and beyond.</li>
                    <li>Most computer networks work very well with the 100 Mbps range of products,
                        but as data transfers within a local rea network increase, the higher bandwidth and capacity
                        of faster networks may be needed. </li>

                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Schedule work outside normal business hours</li>
                    <li>Inform people when your work may disrupt their work</li>
                    <li>Have backup plans in place to repair problems occur</li>
                    <li>Have an installation plan approved by your client in advance (and avoid the need for
                        problem and conflict resolution later).</li>

                <ul class="listno">
                    <li>Inform users who will be affected</li>
                    <li>Isolate the system unit by disconnecting the power supply and exterior cables.</li>
                    <li>Open the case and take anti-static precautions.</li>
                    <li>Identify the location to install card and possibly remove old card.</li>
                    <li>Follow manufacturer's directions.</li>
                    <li>Replace case and cables.</li>
                    <li>Reconnect the power.</li>

            <h3>Informing users</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="cc">
                    <li>Depending on the system to be opened this may be a single user or a group or everyone.</li>
                    <li>The only time you do not have to worry about this step is when the system is not working
                        at all and by working on it, you will restore functionality.</li>
                    <li>If it will take a long time then you still need to keep people informed of the progress.</li>
                    <li>You can judge the necessity of the progress reports by the number of people asking you
                        when it will be fixed or even just How's it going?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Isolating and disconnecting the unit</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="cc">
                    <li>You must first isolate the unit for your own safety and that of the equipment and data
                        stored.</li>
                    <li>Most system units only deal with low voltages within the case (except for the power
                        supply itself) and safety switches on the mains supply (residual current devices, RCDs)
                        reduce the chances of electrocution.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Opening the case and taking anti-static precautions</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="cc">
                    <li>With the system unit in a well-lit, stable work area, you can remove the case. (Remember
                        to put the case parts out of the way to prevent accidents.)
                        At a minimum, you need to use an antistatic wrist strap in a correct manner to
                        avoid causing damage to the system
                        while working on it.</li>
                    <li>The anti-static
                        device works by connecting you to the
                        computer and parts to reduce the voltage
                        difference to zero.</li>
                    <li><b>Static discharge</b> can damage sensitive components in
                        the computer system. They may not fail immediately
                        but the life of components exposed to static discharge
                        is often reduced.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Follow manufacturer's directions</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="cc">
                    <li>Manufacturer's directions usually include instructions for the correct insertion of the NIC.
                        Some manufacturers specify which PCI slot to use, which may require the rearrangement
                        of other cards.</li>
                    <li>The visibility within a system case is often low, particularly with other cards adjacent to
                        the small NICs available.</li>
                    <li>It is important to be sure that the network card is properly seated into the PCI slot.</li>
                    <li>You should be able to see that most of the card's gold edge connectors have gone into the
                        slot and what is left showing is even along the top edge.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Reassembly and connection</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="cc">
                    <li>Reassembly and connection reverses the removal procedure. Remember to disconnect your
                        antistatic wrist-strap from the system as well.</li>
                    <li>Re-locate the system unit and reconnect the exterior cables.</li>
                    <li>When the power is turned on the unit should start up as normal. Be aware of any beeps or
                        warning messages that may be generated as the system performs its self-check.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Installing software drivers</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="cc">
                    <li>The Microsoft Windows operating system should automatically detect the hardware during
                        start-up and a wizard will begin to install drivers necessary for the network card.</li>
                    <li>This may require a re-boot in order to activate the network card successfully. For UNIX or
                        Linux systems, modules may have to be enabled or even a re-compilation of the system
                        kernel.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Patch and crossover cables</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="cc">
                    <li>Most networking hardware will interconnect using standard patch cables.</li>
                    <li>Stranded unshielded twisted pair(UTP) cable is used for flexibility, with an RJ-45
                        modular connector plug on each end.</li>
                    <li>When you need to directly connect a pair of like (similar) devices, a crossover cable must
                        be used.</li>
                    <li>These cables are also made from stranded UTP cable for flexibility with an RJ-45 modular
                        connector plug on each end, while the four pairs of conductors are arranged to swap (cross
                        over) the transmit and receive pairs in just one of the plugs, as shown in Figure 5 on the
                        next page</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Configuration</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="cc">
                    <li>Once new hardware is connected, the equipment is then integrated into the existing
                        network or a new network begins.</li>
                    <li>Integration includes the naming and addressing schemes for the protocols used on the
                        network, which may be specified by the organization.</li>
                    <li>Many new network devices such as routers or switches include a small web-server that
                        allows you to log in to the device and change settings using a web browser.</li>
                    <Li>In this way devices can be configured using any operating system with a web browser.</li>
                    <li>When making changes you must keep track of the IP address of the device, if you change
                        it to suit the network you are working on, you will not be able to connect using the IP
                        address in the browser address bar.</li>
                    <li>Factory defaults are usually in place for username and password, so at a minimum the
                        password needs to be changed to prevent unwanted access.</li>
                    <li>There is often a button to reset factory defaults if the password is lost or forgotten.</li>
                    <li>Unfortunately, this also wipes any configuration changes, so documenting the settings,
                        including any changes made over time, is essential.</li>
                    <li>The reset switch also requires the device to be physically secured, to prevent tampering.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Setting the IP address</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="cc">
                    <li>Each workstation, server or other network peripheral device on a network needs its own
                        unique identification number in the form of an Internet protocol (IP) address.
                    <li>In IP version 4 (used here), known as dotted decimal notation, has a 4-byte binary string
                        that is normally written as four decimal numbers each separated by a period or dot, for
                        example:203.14.151.67.</li>
                    <li>The two choices for setting IP addresses are called static and dynamic. </li>
                    <li>Static IP addresses are changed manually so the address remains the same for a computer
                        until specifically changed.</li>
                    <li> A dynamic host control protocol (DHCP) server allocates dynamic IP addresses, and while
                        they tend to remain the same, they may change without notice.</li>
                    <li>Static IP addresses are manually configured and tend to be used in small networks where
                        changes will not happen very often and a DHCP server is not present on the network.</li>
                    <li>Static IP addresses are also used for routers, gateways, servers and other network resources
                        on any network.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>The ping command</h3>
            <p>The 'ping' command helps confirm the basic connectivity of a network device. Ping stands
                for packet Internet grouper (or groper or gopher).An echo request packet is sent out to the IP address; the receiving system identifies it and
                sends back an acknowledgement.</p>
            
            <h3>Review tasks</h3>
            <p>Tasks define what you are required to do and how to do it. You will need to draw upon your IT
            knowledge and skills to review individual tasks and confirm they are technically correct and
            properly sequenced.</p>

            <h3>Before commencing installation of server hardware or software you should:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Review the user requirements</li>
                    <li>Review the installation plan</li>
                    <li>Review and confirm the existing IT environment</li>
                    <li>Confirm the availability of required resources and materials</li>
                    <li>Review technical tasks(for installation and configuration)</li>
                    <li>Review the testing tasks</li>
                    <li>Review deployment task</li>

                    <li>Review all contingency plans.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Server installation considerations</h3>
            <p>To install server hardware you will need to follow the installation plan along with any vendor or
                        manufacturer's instructions. <b></b>Generally you will need to such as:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Unpack new hardware or assemble server hardware</li>
                    <li>Site or mount the server hardware</li>
                    <li>Power on server hardware</li>
                    <li>Run hardware diagnostics</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Server software considerations</h3>
            <p>Server software refers to both the server operating system and any additional application software
                running on the server. The server operating system must be installed prior to any application
                software. Once again an installation plan should address these tasks.
                The server operating system is the software that will operate the server hardware to provide
                network and services to users. The various methods of installing operating system software on to
                server hardware depend on the software being used. <b>Generally methods used are such as:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Local manual installation</li>
                    <li>Local automated (or scripted) installation</li>
                    <li>Remote installation</li>
                    <li>Image installation</li>
                </ul>
                Application or other software is installed on the server only after the server operating system is
                configured and tested. Other software and can be installed by manual, automated and remote
                installation (as described above).
            </p>

            <h3>Configuring server hardware and software</h3>
            <p>Configuring server hardware and software means setting up the way the hardware and software
            operates to suit the IT environment and organizational or user requirements.
            Generally, server hardware is configured before the server operating system is installed, or
            afterwards if hardware components in an operating server are being changed or added. Software
            may be configured when installed, as part of the installation process, or afterwards, if a default
            installation has been performed. </p>

                        <b>Storage</b>
                        <p>Options like the hardware redundant array of independent disks (RAID), the system which uses
                        multiple hard drives to share or replicate data among the drives, are configured independently of
                        operating systems. You may need to configure RAID options and logical volumes. You may be
                        using remote storage with special adapter cards that may need configuration.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Boot sequences</b>
                        <p>A boot sequence is the set of operations the computer performs when it is switched on which load
                        an operating system. Usually you have the option to select boot orders such as network, CD,
                        which hard disk and so forth. The Intel WFM (Wired for Management) options may need to be
                        set.</p>

                        <b>Specific device configurations</b>
                        <p>Things like the addresses for small computer system interface (SCSI), which is a standard
                        interface and command set for transferring data between devices on both internal and external
                        computer buses, may need to be set on old SCSI devices. Generally bus, port, interrupt request
                        (IRQ) and other settings are usually automatically determined for you with current server
                        hardware. There may be external devices (for example tape drives) that require hardware
                        configuring to connect to the main server hardware.</p>

                        You may need to consult the hardware manufacturer or vendor for information and configuration

                    is an example of environment setting. Policy settings are used to enforce organizational
                    policies and may include disabling certain functions or enforcing a particular setting on
                    end user computers, such as stopping a non-administrative user from login on the server

                        procedures, backup and recovery procedures. The entire system needs to be tested. Test
                        strategies that work the system to its capacity are used. These strategies must ensure that all
                        problems that the server may have, are found before it is placed into production.</p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Parallel implementation</b>
                        <p>Parallel implementation takes place where the old server and software run alongside the new
                        server and software. This is done for a period of time to ensure any problems not detected in the prior testing phase are resolved. The old server and software are then terminated either abruptly or
                        phased out.<br>
                        This method allows the organization to keep functioning as normal, and it also allows much more
                        time for the users to become familiar with the new software. The disadvantage is that it is costly
                        and time consuming for the users to run both operating systems and applications simultaneously.
                        (To counter that disadvantage, a small group or section may pilot the proposed changes, as
                        below.)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Abrupt implementation</b>
                        <p>Abrupt implementation is when the old server and software are completely removed and the new
                        server and software put in place immediately. It requires no transition costs and is very fast, yet
                        there is the risk of costly data loss if the new system fails, or if existing data is not correctly
                        transferred to the new server. Operations can be seriously disrupted if this happens, or if the users
                        have not been adequately trained (with abrupt implementation users are under a lot of pressure to
                        learn the system before the change over).</p>

                        <b>Phased implementation</b>
                        <p>Phased implementation is used with larger applications that can be broken down and installed
                        separately at different times. An example of a phased implementation could be a server providing
                        an accounting application, with the accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger and
                        payroll modules all installed separately in phases with the new operating system. If something
                        does not work it may be only the (general ledger) that has problems or, since the (general ledger)
                        has just been installed, it can be quickly identified as the cause of other problems.</p>

                        <b>Pilot implementation</b>
                        <p>Pilot implementation is where the new server and software are installed and used by one
                        department in the organization, to be tested. Once this pilot site is working as expected, other
                        departments convert, using one of the above mentioned deployment methods.</p>

            <h3>Develop an advanced software installation plan</h3>
            <p>Planning is the first step and foundation of any project. Planning requires thinking about what you
            need to achieve. Having clear goals or outcomes is a starting point to knowing exactly what must
            be done. You can then decide a sequence of activities to meet those goals, and assign resources
            and timelines to each task and to the project as a whole.</p>

                            files or script programs to set installation options that usually require user interaction or selection.
                            <br>This method is more efficient than manual installation but does require the development of
                            installation scripts. Although simpler because users and installation staff are not required to
                            interact with the install process, the script may need to be manually executed at the computer to
                            start the installation.

                            referred to as a roll out which gives the impression of a mechanical production line. The
                            production line analogy becomes appropriate when you are installing the same software over
                            again and again.<br>This method usually involves 'packaging' the software. This means manually installing the software on a test computer. This installed software is then manually configured as required.

                            server known as a Terminal Server. The installed software on the server is then made available
                            for use by users at their networked computer. The software is not installed on the userâ€˜s computer
                            but appears to run as if it were locally installed. But in fact, the software is running on the
                            terminal server and is presented to the user's computer via a terminal session. Note that the
                            software needs to be installed in only one location the terminal server. </p>

            <h3>Network security</h3>
            <p>Security refers to the measures taken to protect certain things or elements of information.
                <br><b>There are three main elements in network security such as:-</b>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li>
                        <b>Confidentiality</b>
                        <p>This means keeping information secret and safe. It means controlling access to information so that
                        only the people with authorisation will access the information. No one else should have access to
                        the information.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Integrity</b>
                        <p>This refers to the correctness of information. It means making sure that the information is kept as
                        it should be and not altered or changed by unauthorised people. It also means protecting the
                        information from changes or corruption by other things like system or program failures or external
                        events.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Availability</b>
                        <p>This refers to the ability to access and use information. It means making sure that the information
                        can be accessed whenever it's required. If information is not available it is useless.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Intruders or hackers</b> Gaining user passwords through manipulation or monitoring. Surprisingly,
                        many people write their passwords down on sticky notes and leave them stuck on the side of
                        their monitor or under their keyboard.</li>
                    <li>Social engineering</b> This practice involves manipulating social relationships in order to gain
                        information, specifically, passwords. For example, the intruder may pose as a network
                        administrator who asks for your password in order to investigate some problems with the
                        network.</li>
                    <li><b>Incorrect configuration of user IDs and groups and their associated file or login access</b></li>
                    <li><b>Network administrators not noticing security gaps in the operating system or application
                        configuration</b></li>
                    <li><b>Lack of a security policy</b> leading to users not knowing or understanding security requirements.</li>
                    <li><b>Users or administrators choosing easy-to-guess passwords</b></li>
                    <li><b>Computer rooms being left unlocked, allowing unauthorised physical access</b></li>
                    <li><b>Back up tapes or floppy disks containing confidential information being discarded in public
                        waste bins</b> and etc...</li>

                        <b>Authentication</b>
                        <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of people who are attempting to access the
                        network or system.<br><b>The most common method used to authenticate users is the Username and Password method.</b>
                            <br><b>Other authentication methods include:-</b>
                            <ul class="kb">

                                    at some time.</li>
                                <li><b>Usernames with dynamic passwords</b> the password is constantly changed by a password
                                    generator synchronised with the user and system.</li>
                                <li><b>Other challenge</b> response systemsâ€”this may involve PINs, questions to the user requiring
                                    various answers or actions.</li>
                                <li><b>Certificate based</b> this requires the user to have an electronic certificate or token. This
                                    may also need to be digitally signed by a trusted authority. Kerberos is an example.</li>
                                <li><b>Physical devices</b> these include the use of smartcards and biometrics. Generally the entire
                                    authentication process occurs on the local workstation, thus eliminating the need for a
                                    special server.</li>

                        <b>Authorization</b>
                        <p>Once a user has been authenticated(that is their identity validated) they are granted access to the
                            network or system. For the user to then access data or an application or execute some task or
                            command they need be authorized to do so.<br> The authorisation process determines what the user
                            can do on the network. In other words it enforces the organization policy as applicable to the user.</p>
