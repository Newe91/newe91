            <h2>Unit 1: Define a process for design security</h2>
            <h3>Introduction network security design</h3>
            <p><b>Network security design is a strategy approach to creating a secure network infrastructure.</b>
                It involves planning, implementing and managing various security measure  to protect data, system and communication
                within a network.<br><b> Network security design is an ongoing process</b> that requires regular review and adaptation to address emerging threats and changes
                in the organizational landscape. By adapting a comprehensive and proactive approach, organizations can create a robust network security framework to safeguard their digital assets. 
                <br> 
                <b>Key considerations in network security design:-</b>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Risk assessment</b> Identify and evaluate potential risks and threats to the 
                    network. This include understanding the value of asset ,potential vulnerabilities and the like hood of various security incidents.</li>
                    <li><b>Security goals and objectives</b> define clear security goal and objectives aligned with organizational
                        overall business objectives. This include confidentiality, integrity, availability and compliance with industry regulations.</li>
                    <li><b>Defense in depth strategy</b> implement multiple layers of security controls to create a defense in depth strategy.
                        This include combination  of technologies, policies and procedures to mitigate risks at various levels.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Segmentation</b> divide the network into segments to contain and isolate potential security incident.
                        Segmentation helps prevent lateral movement of attackers within  the network and limits the impact fo security breaches.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Access controls</b> Enforce strong access controls by implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
                        This include user access policies, role based access control(RBAC) and least privilege principles.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Data encryption</b> use encryption protocols to protect sensitive data during transmission and storage.
                        This crucial, especially  for data traversing public networks or stored in the cloud.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Firewall configuration</b> Deploy firewalls strategically to control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic.
                        Consider both hardware and software firewalls to provide a comprehensive defense against unauthorized access.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Intrusion detection and prevention systems(IDPS)</b> Integrate IDPS to detect and respond to potential security incidents in real time.
                        There system can analyze network traffic, identify anomalies and take proactive measure to prevent or mitigate threats.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Virtual private networks(VPNS)</b> Implement VPNs to secure remote access and communication over untrusted networks.
                        This is essential for protecting data as it travels between locations and the load network.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Security auditing and monitoring</b> establish continuous monitoring and auditing processes to detect and security
                        events promptly. This include the analysis of logs, alerts and other indicators of compromise.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Incident response plan</b> develop a well defined incident response plan that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident.
                        This include roles and responsibilities ,communication plan and strategies for recovery.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Vendor and third party security</b> evaluate and ensure the security practices of third party vendors and partners.
                        This is crucial to prevent security weaknesses introduced through external connections.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>User education and awareness</b> educate users about security best practices and potential threats.
                        A well informed user base can serve as an additional layer of defense against social engineering and other user centric attacks.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Regular security assessments</b> conduct regular security assessment, including penetration testing and scanning, to identify and address potential weaknesses in the network.</li>
                    <li><b>Scalability and flexibility</b> design the network security infrastructure to be scalable and adaptable to evolving threats and business requirements.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                        <b>Tabletop exercise</b>
                        <p>Conduct a tabletop exercise where incident response team members simulate their responses to the identified scenarios. Discuss and validate the actions taken, communication protocols and coordination among team members.</p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Simulation testing</b>
                        <p>Conduct more hands on simulation testing, simulating an actual incident in a controlled environment. Interact with real incident response tools, systems and data as if it were a live incident.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Evaluation</b>
                        <p>Assess the effectiveness of the incident response plan and the performance of incident response team members. Identify any weaknesses, gaps or areas for improvement in the incident response process.</p>
                    </li>
