                                <p>Virtual Reality is a computer-generated simulation of an environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a headset. In VR, the user is fully immersed in a digital world that replaces the real world entirely. This technology aims to create a sensory experience including sight, sound and sometimes touch.</p>

                            <li><b>Augmented Reality(AR)</b>
                                <p>Augmented Reality overlays digital information onto the real world through devices like smartphones or tablets with cameras. AR enhances the user's perception of reality by adding computer-generated elements to their view of the physical world. It does not replace the real world but adds layers of digital information on top of it.</p>
