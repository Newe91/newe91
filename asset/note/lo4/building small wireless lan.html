            <h2>Unit 1: Confirm client and equipment requirements</h2>
            <h3> Client and organizational requirements</h3>
            <p>To design a network that meets customers needs,  the organizational goals, organizational
            constraints, technical goals and technical constraints must be identified. 
            We begin by explaining how to assess the scope of the design project. After gathering all customer
            requirements, the designer must identify and obtain any missing information and reassess the scope
            of the design project to develop a comprehensive understanding of the customer's needs.</P>

            <h3>Assessing the Scope of a network design project</h3>
            <p><b>When assessing the scope of a network design consider the following:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Whether the design is for a new network or is a modification of an existing
                        network.</li>
                    <li>Whether the design is for an entire enterprise network, a subset of the network, or
                        a single segment or module.</li>
                    <li>Whether the design addresses a single function or the network's entire
                        functionality.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Identify required information</h3>
            <p>Determining requirements includes extracting initial requirements from the customer and then
                refining these with other data that has been collected from the organization.
            </p>
            <h3>Extracting initial requirements</h3>
            <p>Initial design requirements are typically extracted from the Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request
                for Information(RFI) documents that the customer issues. An RFP is a formal request to vendors
                for proposals that meet the requirements that the document identifies. An RFI is typically a less
                formal document an organization issues to solicit ideas and information from vendors about a
                specific project.<br>The first step in the design process should be pre-documenting (sifting, processing, reordering,
                translating and so forth) the design requirements and reviewing them with the customer for
                verification and approval, obtaining direct customer input, in either oral or written form.
            </p>
            <h3>Approach to developing the design requirements document:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li>Extract the initial customer requirements(from the RFP or RFI).</li>
                    <li>Query the customer for a verbal description of the initial requirements.</li>
                    <li>Produce a draft document that describes the design requirements.</li>
                    <li>Verify the design requirements with the customer and obtain customer approval</li>
                    <li>Revise the document as necessary to eliminate errors and omissions. 2 to 5 are repeated if the
                        customer has additional comments about the draft document.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Step to gathering data for design requirements</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li>Identify the planned network applications and network services</li>
                    <li>Determine1 the organizational goals</li>
                    <li>Determine the possible organizational constraints</li>
                    <li>Determine the technical goals</li>
                    <li>Determine the technical constraints that must be taken into account</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Planned applications and network services </h3>
            <p>
                The designer must determine which applications the customer is planning to use and the importance of each of these applications. Using a table helps organize and categorize the applications and services planned;
                <br><b>the table should contain the following information:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Planned application types:</b> include e-mail, groupware (tools that aid group work), voice networking, web browsing, video on demand (VoD), databases, file sharing and transfer, computer-aided manufacturing and so forth.</li>
                    <li><b>Applications:</b> specific applications that will be used, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Cisco Unified Meeting Place and so forth.</li>
                    <li><b>Level of importance:</b> the importance of the applications—whether critical, important, or not important is noted.</li>
                    <li><b>Comments:</b> additional notes taken during the data-gathering process.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Some sample questions a
                designer might ask to help determine organizational goals include the following:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>What are you trying to accomplish with this project?</li>
                    <li>What business challenges are you currently facing?</li>
                    <li>What are the consequences of not resolving these issues?</li>
                    <li>What is the major objective of this project?</li>
                    <li>What is driving the change?</li>
                    <li>What other technology projects and business initiatives will affect your group in the next two to five years?</li>
                    <li>What skill sets does your technical staff currently have?</li>
                    <li>What is your goal for return on investment?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Organizational constraints</h3>
            <p>
                When assessing organizational goals, it is important to analyze any organizational constraints that
                might affect the network design.<br>
                <b></b>Some sample questions the designer might ask to help determine
                organizational constraints include the following:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>What in your current processes works well?</li>
                    <li>What in your current processes does not work well?</li>
                    <li>Which processes are labor-intensive?</li>
                    <li>What are the barriers for implementation in your organization?</li>
                    <li>What are your major concerns with the implementation of a new solution?</li>
                    <li>What projects already have budget approval?</li>
                    <li>Are other planned technology projects and business initiatives compatible with your
                        current infrastructure and technology solutions?</li>
                    <li>Do you have a budget for technical development for your staff?</li>
                    <li>Are there any policies in place that might affect the project?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Typical constraints include the following:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Budget:</b> reduced budgets or limited resources often force network designers to implement
                        an affordable solution rather than the best technical solution. This usually entails some
                        compromises in availability, manageability, performance and scalability.</li>
                    <li><b>Personnel:</b> the availability of trained personnel within the organization might be a design
                        consideration. Organizations might not have enough trained personnel, or they might not
                        have enough personnel.</li>
                    <li><b>Policies:</b> organizations have different policies about protocols, standards, vendors and
                        applications; to design the network successfully, the designer must understand these
                        policies.</li>
                    <li><b>Schedule:</b> the organization's executive management must discuss and approve the project
                        schedule to avoid possible disagreements about deadlines.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Technical goals</h3>
            <p>The technical goals of the project must also be determined before the design starts.
                <b>Some sample
                questions the designer might ask to help determine technical goals include the following:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>What infrastructure issues exist or will exist related to your applications rollouts?</li>
                    <li>What skill sets does your technical staff need to acquire?</li>
                    <li>Does your current network have any performance issues?</li>
                    <li>Which portions of your network are considered mission-critical?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>The following list describes some common technical goals:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Improve network performance:</b> an increase in the number of users and the introduction
                        of new applications might degrade network performance, especially responsiveness and
                        throughput.</li>
                    <li><b>Decrease expected downtime and related expenses:</b> when a network failure occurs,
                        downtime must be minimal and the network must respond quickly to minimize related
                        costs.</li>
                    <li><b>Modernize outdated technologies:</b> the emergence of new network technologies and
                        applications demands regular updates to and replacement of outdated equipment and
                        technologies.
                    <li><b>Improve scalability of the network:</b> networks must be designed to provide for upgrades
                        and future growth.</li>
                    <li><b>Simplify network management:</b> simplify network management functions so that they are
                        easy to use and easily understood.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Technical constraints</h3>
            <p><b>Some sample questions the designer might ask to help determine technical constraints
                include the following:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>How do you determine your technology priorities?</li>
                    <li>Do you have a technology refresh process?</li>
                    <li>What urgent technical problems require immediate resolution or mitigation?</li>
                    <li>Do you have a plan for technical development for your staff in specific areas?</li>
                    <li>Do any applications require special network features (protocols and so forth)?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3></h3>
            <p><b>Good network design addresses constraints by identifying possible trade-offs, such as the following:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Existing equipment:</b> the network design process is usually progressive; legacy equipment
                        must coexist with new equipment.</li>
                    <li><b>Bandwidth availability:</b> insufficient bandwidth in parts of the network where the
                        bandwidth cannot be increased because of technical constraints must be resolved by other
                        means.</li>
                    <li><b>Application compatibility:</b> if the new network is not being introduced at the same time as
                        new applications, the design must provide compatibility with old applications.</li>
                    <li><b>Lack of qualified personnel:</b> lack of qualified personnel suggests that the designer must
                        consider the need for additional training; otherwise, certain features might have to be
                        dropped.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                practices for ensuring that your data and devices are safe from malicious actors:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Enabling two-factor authentication(2FA)</b> 
                        <p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to the login process. It requires users to
                            enter both a username and password as well as a code that is generated by an authenticator app.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Using strong password</b>
                        <p>Using a strong password is one of the most important best practices for wireless network security.
                            A strong password is at least eight characters long and includes a mix of upper- and lower-case
                            letters, numbers and symbols. Passwords should be changed regularly to ensure that they remain
                            secure.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Encrypting data </b>
                        <p>Encrypting data is another important best practice for wireless network security. Data encryption
                            scrambles data so that it can only be decrypted and read by authorized users. This helps to protect
                            sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p>
                    </li>

                        <b>Disabling SSID broadcast</b>
                        <p>Disabling SSID broadcast is another best practice for wireless network security. When SSID
                            broadcast is enabled, it allows anyone within range of the wireless network to see the network name.You can disable SSID broadcast by accessing the wireless router's configuration page and
                            disabling the SSID broadcast feature.</p>

                        <b>Using MAC filtering</b>
                        <p>
                            Using MAC filtering is another best practice for wireless network security. MAC addresses are
                            unique identifiers assigned to devices that connect to a network.</p>
                    </li>

                        <b>Enabling WPA3 security</b>
                        <p>Enabling WPA3 security is another best practice for wireless network security. WPA3 is the most
                            recent and most secure wireless security protocol. It provides stronger protection than WPA2 and
                            should be used whenever possible.</p>

                        <b>Using a VPN</b>
                        <p>Using a VPN is another best practice for wireless network security. A VPN encrypts all traffic
                            between a device and the VPN server, making it more difficult for someone to eavesdrop on the
                            connection. This is especially important when using public Wi-Fi networks, as they are often less
                            secure than private ones.</p>

                        <b>Using a firewall</b>
                        <p>Using a firewall is another best practice for wireless network security. A firewall helps to protect
                            the network by blocking incoming traffic that is not authorized. This can be especially important
                            in preventing attacks from malware and other malicious software.</p>

                        <b>Disabling Universal Plug and Play(UPnP)</b>
                        <p>Universal Plug and Play(UPnP) is a protocol that allows devices to automatically discover and
                            connect to each other. This can be a security risk, as it allows unauthorized devices to potentially
                            gain access to the network. To disable UPnP, access the wireless router's configuration page and disable the feature. You can also disable UPnP on individual devices by accessing the settings
                            menu.</p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Disabling unnecessary services</b>
                        <p>You often find that routers come with a number of unnecessary services enabled. These can be a
                            security risk, as they can provide potential attackers with information about the network. To
                            disable unnecessary services, access the wireless router's configuration page and disable any
                            services that are not needed.</p>

            <h3>Define wireless network requirements</h3>
            <p>Requirements define what the wireless network must do, which provides the foundation for the
                design. Requirements for a wireless network include needs, such as signal coverage in all elevators
                and support for voice telephony. Leave the technical details, such as specific technologies (such
                as 2.4GHz vs. 5GHz 802.11n), components and configuration settings to the designers after all
                requirements are well-defined and agreed upon.<br>
                <b>Requirements to consider
                    before implementing a wireless network, consider the following types of requirements:-</b>

                            across IP domains, creating a need to manage IP addresses dynamically. Some users, however,
                            may be stationary, such as wireless desktops.</p>

            <h3>Selecting appropriate position for access point</h3>
            <p>Wireless Access Point (WAP) placement is an important aspect of setting up and maintaining a
                wireless network. Proper placement of WAPs ensures good coverage, capacity and performance.
                <br>
                <b>Here are some best practices for WAP placement:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Conduct a site survey</b>
                        <p>Before installing any WAPs, conduct a Wireless site survey to
                        identify areas with poor coverage, high demand and potential sources of interference. This
                        will help you to determine the optimal location for each WAP.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Use ceiling-mounted WAPs</b>
                        <p>Ceiling-mounted WAPs provide better coverage than wall-
                        mounted WAPs as they can reach a wider area and provide more uniform coverage.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Place WAPs in the center of the coverage area</b>
                        <p>In general, WAPs should be placed in the
                        center of the area they are supposed to cover, as this will ensure good coverage for the entire
                        area.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Avoid physical obstructions</b><p>Physical obstructions such as walls, ceilings and furniture
                        can interfere with wireless signals, so it important to avoid placing WAPs near these types
                        of obstructions.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Use multiple WAPs</b><p> In large areas, it important to use multiple WAPs to ensure good
                        coverage and capacity. This will also help to reduce the risk of congestion and ensure that
                        users have a good experience.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Use Power over Ethernet(PoE)</b><p>PoE allows WAPs to receive power over the same cable
                        that carries the network data, making it easy to install them in a variety of locations.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Use wireless planning tools</b><p>wireless planning tools can help to predict coverage, capacity,
                        and performance of wireless networks, by simulating the environment and giving you an
                        idea of how the wireless network will perform.</p></li>

            <h3>Five guidelines for you to follow when installing access points</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Place access points where Wi-Fi will be used the most</b>
                        <p>
                            The first rule of proper access point placement is to determine the locations where Wi-Fi networks
                            will be used the most. This seems like it should be obvious, but it makes a huge difference in
                            determining the optimal placement of access points across an infrastructure. The closer a device is
                            to an access point, the better its connection will be.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Precise access point placement is key</b>
                        <p>Access point placement is not just about picking the right general area to install a device. You also
                            need to consider the precise physical placement for the access point in each room/location you
                            need to service. Access points need to be built in optimal locations to provide the best signal
                            strength to the areas it will cover.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Avoid coverage overlap whenever possible</b>
                        <p>
                            When designing your wireless infrastructure, you need to select the best access point locations that
                            will provide maximum coverage for your business. The simple answer to this problem is installing
                            access points anywhere you can, but this is almost always a bad idea. Not only does this introduce
                            unnecessary costs, but it also generates a lot of coverage overlap</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Electronic devices</b>
                        <p>
                            Devices that emit electromagnetic signals, such as microwaves, are notorious for completely
                            blocking wireless signals. Whenever possible, access points should be placed as far away from
                            these devices as possible.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Building materials</b>
                        <p>
                            The building materials of the structures your business operates in can cause varying degrees of
                            wireless signal interference or blockage. Concrete, brick and other dense materials are infamous
                            for blocking Wi-Fi signals. Your team should place access points in areas that provide the best
                            area of coverage when considering the building materials around it.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Wireless Routers</h3>
            <p> Wireless routers which provide Wi-Fi connectivity, are usually powered
                by connecting them to a standard electrical outlet. They require a
                continuous power source to function and transmit wireless signals.</p>
            <h3>Wireless Access Points</h3>
            <p>Similar to routers, wireless access points are devices that provide
                wireless connectivity in a specific area or location. They may be powered through an
                electrical outlet or, in some cases, through Power over Ethernet (PoE) technology, which
                allows both data and power to be transmitted over the same Ethernet cable.</p>

            <h3>Wireless Cameras</h3>
            <p>Wireless security cameras or other types of wireless cameras may be
                powered by batteries or by connecting them to an electrical outlet. Battery-
                powered wireless cameras are often designed for flexibility and portability,
                while those connected to an outlet can provide continuous power.</p>
            <h3>Wireless Devices</h3>
            <p>Various wireless devices, such as smartphones, tablets and laptops, have
                built-in batteries that power their wireless capabilities. These devices need to be periodically
                recharged to maintain their wireless functionality.</p>

            <h3>When planning the testing of a WLAN consider the following forms of testing:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Signal coverage testing:</b>
                        <p>Signal coverage testing determines where client devices are able
                        to satisfy coverage requirements. This testing may be part of performing a WLAN site
                        survey or done after the network is installed to determine the as-installed signal coverage.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Performance testing:</b><p> Performance testing determines whether the WLAN can satisfy user
                        needs for using specific applications over the WLAN.</p></li>
                    <li><b>In-motion testing:</b><p> In-motion testing determines whether users can continue to make use
                        of applications while roaming throughout the coverage areas, especially when the roaming
                        requires handoffs between access points.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Security vulnerability testing:</b>
                        <p>Security vulnerability testing ensures that the WLAN

                    <li><b>Acceptance/verification testing:</b><p> After installing a WLAN, it is important to run a series
                        of acceptance/verification tests to ensure that the WLAN satisfies all requirements. This is
                        especially important if the organization is having a contractor install the WLAN.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Simulation testing:</b><p>In some cases, such as when implementing a very large WLAN, it
                        may be beneficial to simulate the behavior of the WLAN before actually installing it. This
                        can provide helpful feedback when designing the system, especially if the WLAN will have
                        critical performance requirements.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Prototype testing:</b><p>Prototype testing involves implementing an individual function of the
                        WLAN that is not well understood before deploying the complete system. For example, an
                        organization may not be very familiar with 802.1X authentication systems and may benefit
                        by implementing the 802.1X authentication in a lab environment with a limited number of
                        test client devices.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Pilot testing:</b><p>Before installing the WLAN across the entire organization, which may
                        include numerous buildings and different applications.</p></li>

            <h2>Unit 3:Configure network</h2>
            <h3>Some of the basic technologies of wireless
                network systems:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Wireless Local Area Network</b><p>
                        A Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is a type of local area network that uses high frequency
                        radio waves rather than wires to communicate between network-enabled devices.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Access Point</b><p>
                        A wireless access point (AP) is a hardware device that allows wireless communication devices,
                        such as PDAs and mobile computers, to connect to a wireless network. Usually, an AP connects
                        into to a wired network and provides a bridge for data communication between wireless and wired
                        devices.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Service Set Identifier</b><p>
                        A Service Set Identifier (SSID) is a configurable identification that allows wireless clients to
                        communicate with an appropriate access point. With proper configuration, only clients with correct
                        SSID can communicate with the access points. In effect, the SSID acts as a single
                        shared password between access points and clients.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Open System Authentication</b><p>
                        Open System Authentication is the default authentication protocol for the 802.11 wireless
                        standard. It consists of a simple authentication request containing the station ID and an
                        authentication response containing success or failure data. Upon successful authentication, both
                        stations are considered mutually authenticated.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Shared Key Authentication</b><p>
                        Shared Key Authentication is a standard challenge and response mechanism that makes use of
                        WEP and a shared secret key to provide authentication. Upon encrypting the challenge text with
                        WEP using the shared secret key, the authenticating client will return the encrypted challenge text
                        to the access point for verification.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Ad-Hoc Mode</b><p>
                        Ad-hoc mode is one of the networking topologies provided in the 802.11 standard. It consists of
                        at least two wireless stations where no access point is involved in their communication. Ad-hoc
                        mode WLANs are normally less expensive to run, as no APs are needed for their communication.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Infrastructure mode</b><p>Infrastructure mode is another networking topology in the 802.11 standard, in addition to ad-hoc
                        mode. It consists of a number of wireless stations and access points. The access points usually
                        connect to a larger wired network. This network topology can scale to form large-scale networks
                        with arbitrary coverage and complexity.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol</b><p>
                        Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) Protocol is a basic security feature in the IEEE 802.11 standard,
                        intended to provide confidentiality over a wireless network by encrypting information sent over
                        the network. A key-scheduling flaw has been discovered in WEP, so it is now considered as
                        unsecured because a WEP key can be cracked in a few minutes with the aid of automated tools.
                        Therefore, WEP should not be used unless a more secure method is not available.</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Wi-Fi Protected Access</b>
                        <p>
                            <b>Wi-Fi Protected Access(WPA)</b> is a wireless security protocol designed to address and fix the
                            known security issues in WEP. WPA provides users with a higher level of assurance that their data
                            will remain protected by using Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for data encryption.
                            802.1x authentication has been introduced in this protocol to improve user authentication.
                            <br><b>Wi-Fi Protected Access 2(WPA2)</b> based on IEEE 802.11i, is a new wireless security protocol
                            in which only authorised users can access a wireless device, with features supporting
                            stronger cryptography(e.g. Advanced Encryption Standard or AES), stronger authentication
                            control (e.g. Extensible Authentication Protocol or EAP), key management, replay attack
                            protection and data integrity.<br>
                            <br><b>Wi-Fi Protected Access 3(WPA3)</b> is a new wireless security standard built on WPA2 but brings
                            new features to enhance Wi-Fi security for more robust authentication and enhanced cryptographic
                            strength, while maintaining resiliency of mission critical networks. The WPA3-Personal mode
                            utilizes the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals key establishment protocol as defined in IEEE
                            802.11-2016 to strengthen password-based authentication against brute-force attacks.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Parking Lot attack</h3>
            <p>
                Access points emit radio signals in a circular pattern and the signals usually extend beyond the
                physical boundaries of the area they intend to cover. Signals can be intercepted outside buildings,
                or even through the floors in multi-story buildings. As a result, attackers can implement a "parking
                lot" attack, where they actually sit in the organization’s parking lot and try to access internal hosts
                via the wireless network.</p>
            <h3>Shared Key Authentication Flaw</h3>
            <p>
                Shared key authentication can easily be exploited through a passive attack by eavesdropping on
                both the challenge and the response between the access point and the authenticating client. Such
                an attack is possible because the attacker can capture both the plaintext (the challenge) and
                the cipher text (the response).</p>
            <h3>Service Set Identifier Flaw</h3>
            <p>
                Access points come with default SSIDs. If the default SSID is not changed, these units can easily
                be compromised. In addition, SSIDs are sent over the air as clear text if WEP is disabled, allowing
                the SSID to be captured by monitoring network traffic. For some products, even when WEP is
                enabled, management messages containing the SSID will still be broadcasted in clear text by
                access points and clients, making it possible for an attacker to sniff SSIDs and gain access to the
                wireless LAN.</p>

            <h3>The Vulnerability of Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol</h3>
            <p>Data passing through a wireless LAN with WEP disabled (which is the default setting for most
                products) is susceptible to eavesdropping and data modification attacks. However, even when
                WEP is enabled, the confidentiality and integrity of wireless traffic is still at risk because a number
                of flaws in WEP have been revealed which seriously undermine its claims to security.<br><b>In particular,
                the following attacks on WEP are possible:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Passive attacks to decrypt traffic based on known plaintext and chosen cipher text
                        attacks.</li>
                    <li>Passive attacks to decrypt traffic based on statistical analysis on cipher texts.</li>
                    <li>Active attacks to inject new traffic from unauthorized mobile stations.</li>
                    <li>Active attacks to modify data.</li>
                    <li>Active attacks to decrypt traffic, based on tricking the access point into redirecting
                        wireless traffic to an attacker's machine.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>The most wireless Network Threats</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Accidental Association:</b> overlapping networks,unintentionally connect to neighbors.
                    <li><b>Malicious Association:</b> malicious access points(Free public Wi-Fi) can steal
                        passwords.</li>
                    <li><b>Ad-Hoc Networks:</b> two computers can exchange data.</li>
                    <li><b>Nontraditional Networks:</b> bluetooth can be used to eavesdrop.</li>
                    <li><b>MAC Spoofing:</b> change MAC address to match a privileged computer.</li>
                    <li><b>Man-In-The-Middle Attacks:</b> Using rogue access point between the user and the real
                        access point.</li>
                    <li><b>Denial of Service(DoS):</b> Keep the media busy 8. Network Injection: Spoof
                        routing/management messages</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>To reduce Wireless Network Threats</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Turn-off SSID broadcast</li>
                    <li>Use Cryptic SSID names</li>
                    <li>Reduce signal strength</li>
                    <li>Locate APs away from boundary</li>
                    <li>Use encryption</li>
                    <li>Use IEEE 802.1x network access control</li>
                    <li>Change the router user ID from default</li>
                    <li>Change the router password from default</li>
                    <li>MAC filtering</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Configuring security and other key parameters</h3>
            <h3>None(Plain text)</h3>
            <p>
                If you select none as your security mode, no additional security settings are configurable on the
                WAP device. This mode means that any data transferred to and from the WAP device is not
                encrypted. This security mode can be useful during initial network configuration or for problem
                solving, but it is not recommended for regular use on the internal network because it is not secure.</p>
            <h3>Static WEP</h3>
            <p><b>Wired Equivalent Privacy(WEP)</b> is a data encryption protocol for 802.11 wireless networks. All
                wireless stations and access points on the network are configured with a static 64-bit (40-bit secret
                key plus 24-bit initialization vector (IV)) or 128-bit (104-bit secret key plus 24-bit IV) Shared Key
                for data encryption.<br>
                <b>Static WEP is not the most secure mode available</b> but it offers more protection than setting the
                security mode to None(Plain text), as it does prevent an outsider from easily sniffing out
                unencrypted wireless traffic.<br>
                WEP encrypts data moving across the wireless network based on a static key. The encryption
                algorithm is a stream cipher called RC4.</p>
            <h3>Transfer Key Index</h3>
            <p>Enter a key index list. Key indexes 1 through 4 are available. The default
                is 1. The Transfer Key Index indicates which WEP key the WAP device uses to encrypt the data
                it transmits. 
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Key Length</b> Choose either 64 bits or 128 bits as the length of the key.</li>
                    <li><b>Key Type</b> Choose either ASCII or Hex as the key type.</li>
                    <li><b>WEP Keys</b> You can specify up to four WEP keys. In each text box, enter a string of
                        characters for each key.</li>
                    <li><b>ASCII</b> Includes uppercase and lowercase alphabetic letters, the numeric digits and
                        special symbols such as @ and #.</li>
                    <li><b>Hex</b> Includes digits 0 to 9 and the letters A to F.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>If you use Static WEP, these rules apply:</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>All client stations must have the Wireless LAN (WLAN) security set to WEP and all
                        clients must have one of the WEP keys specified on the WAP device in order to decode
                        AP-to-station data transmissions.</li>
                    <li>The WAP device must have all keys used by clients for station-to-AP transmit so that it
                        can decode the station transmissions.</li>
                    <li>The client stations can use different keys to transmit data to the access point.</li>
                    <li>On some wireless client software, you can configure multiple WEP keys and define a client
                        station transfer key index and then set the stations to encrypt the data that they transmit
                        using different keys.</li>
                    <li>You cannot mix 64-bit and 128-bit WEP keys between the access point and its client
                        stations.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Dynamic WEP</h3>
            <p>
                Dynamic WEP refers to the combination of 802.1x technology and the Extensible Authentication
                Protocol (EAP). With Dynamic WEP security, WEP keys are changed dynamically.</p>

            <h3>Testing security and firewall arrangements</h3>
            <p>
                A firewall is a vital component of an organization’s security infrastructure and it needs to be
                protected against exploitation.Firewall testing is like auditing your network security.</p>

            <h3>Methods for Testing Firewall Security</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Penetration Testing</b><p>
                        Firewall penetration testing, usually undertaken by penetration testers, simulates cyber attacks on
                        your network devices, similar to how a hacker would infiltrate systems. This form of security
                        testing mimics actual threats, thus gauging the robustness of your firewall policy and other
                        defenses.</p></li>

            <h3>IP(Internet Protocol) Address</h3>
            <p>A device on the internet or a local network is identified by its specific IP address, which is different
                from other addresses.<br>
                <b>Finding Out Your IP Address</b>
                You can discover your IP address in a variety of ways. The simplest method would be to enter
                "what is my IP address" into a search engine like Google.
                For Windows users, navigate to <b>Start > Settings > Network & internet and choose the Wi-Fi
                network you're connected to obtain your IP address. Locate your IP address next to "IPv4 address"
                under Properties.</b></p>
            <h3>MAC Address</h3>
            <p>In computer networking, the physical address that identifies each device on a given network is
                called the Media Access Control (MAC) address. It is also known as Physical address, hardware
                address, or BIA (Burned In Address). It is 12-digit and 64-bit long, the first 24 bits are utilized for
                the OUI(Organization Unique Identifier) and the remaining 24 bits are used for NIC/vendor-
                specific information. It operates on the OSI model's data link layer.
                It is supplied by the device's manufacturer and included in its NIC, which is ideally fixed and
                cannot be modified.</p>

            <h3>Ping</h3>
            <p>
                Ping a computer network management tool is used to determine whether a host is accessible over
                an IP network.</p>

            <h3>Address Resolution Protocol(ARP)</h3>
            <p>
                The Address Resolution Protocol is a layer 2 protocol used to translate MAC addresses to IP
                addresses.
                All hosts on a network may be found using their IP address, although NICs use MAC addresses
                rather than IP addresses. ARP is the protocol that connects an IP address to a MAC address.</p>

            <h3>Network Scanning Tools</h3>
            <p>Network Scanning Tools is software that detects network flaws and protects the system
                from unusual or abnormal activities.</p>
            <h3>The following are some of the most common network scanning tools:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Nexpose</b> is a network scanning program that is used to do network scanning. To
                        do the scan, it normally executes the Nmap scripts in the background.</li>
                    <li><b>Nessus</b> is another network scanning tool used to ensure application security by
                        magnifying flaws. It like nexpose, checks particular files and directories containing data
                        relating to the device's security setup.</li>
                    <li><b>Nmap</b> is another command-line-based network scanning program that is included
                        with several Linux distributions. It performs a scan to determine the condition of a port
                        using either the TCP or UDP protocols. It is fast and powerful enough to scan all 65535
                        ports.</li>
                    <li><b>Zenmap</b> is the graphical user interface (GUI) based version of the Nmap network
                        security scanner. Its GUI helps easily map out a network environment.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>


            <h3>ways to check how many devices are connected to my network</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Log into the administrative IP address of your router. Typically, it is 192.168.0.1 or
                        192.168.1.1.</li>
                    <li>Launch a web browser on your PC or mobile device, enter your default gateway IP address,
                        and press Enter.</li>
                    <li>Use the administrator username and password to log in. For the default credentials, consult the
                        router's documentation.</li>
                    <li>You should be able to see the devices connected to your network on the router's home page or
                        in the router's administrative panel (the interface may vary depending on the router's make and
                        model).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Techniques to help you achieve the best performance and user experience:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Identify and classify traffic</b>
                        <p>The first step to optimize wireless and mobile networks is to identify and classify the traffic that
                            flows through them. You can use tools and protocols such as deep packet inspection (DPI),
                            network analytics and quality of service (QoS) to monitor and categorize the traffic according to
                            its source, destination, content and priority. For example, you can distinguish between voice,
                            video, web, gaming and IoT traffic and assign different levels of service and resources to each.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Apply traffic shaping and management</b>
                        <p>The next step is to apply traffic shaping and management techniques to control and optimize the
                            flow of traffic. Traffic shaping is the process of manipulating the rate, volume and direction of
                            traffic to meet the network's capacity and objectives. Traffic management is the process of
                            enforcing policies and rules to ensure the quality and security of traffic. For example, you can use
                            traffic shaping to limit or prioritize certain types of traffic and use traffic management to block or
                            filter unwanted or malicious traffic.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Optimize network protocols and parameters</b>
                        <p>Another step is to optimize the network protocols and parameters that govern the communication
                            and transmission of traffic. Network protocols are the rules and standards that enable different
                            devices and systems to exchange data and information. Network parameters are the settings and
                            values that affect the performance and behavior of network protocols. For example, you can
                            optimize the network protocols and parameters to reduce overhead, improve efficiency, enhance
                            security and adapt to changing conditions.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Leverage network slicing and virtualization</b>
                        <p>A further step is to leverage network slicing and virtualization technologies to create and manage
                            multiple logical networks within a single physical network. Network slicing is the process of
                            dividing a network into multiple segments or slices, each with its own characteristics and
                            capabilities. Network virtualization is the process of abstracting and decoupling the network
                            resources and functions from the underlying hardware and software. For example, you can use
                            network slicing and virtualization to isolate and customize different types of traffic and to increase
                            flexibility and scalability..</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Implement edge computing and caching</b>
                        <p>A final step is to implement edge computing and caching solutions to reduce the latency and
                            congestion of traffic. Edge computing is the process of moving the computation and processing of
                            data closer to the source or destination of traffic, rather than relying on centralized servers or cloud
                            platforms.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>User documentation and appropriate media</h3>
            <p>
                Books, manuals, computer-based tutorials and online help are all media for user documentation.
                Traditionally user documentation has consisted of a range of paper based documents. However,
                we are no longer limited to these and organizations are shifting their paper-based user
                documentation to an online form. <b>There are very good reasons for this:-</b> Increased productivity,increased corporate intelligence,consistency and quality.</p>

                    <li><b>Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) </b>  used to extend the boundaries of the local wired network (LAN). WLANs use RF technology and
                        conform to the IEEE 802.11 standards. They allow many users to connect to a wired network through a device
                        known as an Access Point (AP). An Access Point provides a connection between wireless hosts and hosts on an
                        Ethernet wired network.</li>
                    <li><b>Wireless Metropolitan Area Network(WMAN)</b> provides RF coverage to a metropolitan area such as a city and the surrounding suburbs.</li>
                    <li><b>Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)</b> provide coverage over extremely large areas. A good example of a WWAN is the cell phone
                        network. These networks use technologies such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or Global System for
                        Mobile Communication (GSM) and are often regulated by government agencies.

            <h3>Standard organizations</h3>
            <p>Each of the standards organizations discussed below help to guide a different aspect of the wireless networking
                industry.
                The International Telecommunication Union Radio communication Sector (ITU-R) and local entities such as the
                Federal Communications Commission (FCC) set the rules for what the user can do with a radio transmitter. These
                organizations manage and regulate frequencies, power levels and transmission methods. They also work together
                to help guide the growth and expansion that is being demanded by wireless users.
            </p>

            <h3>Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</h3>
            <p>FCC regulates communications within the United States as well as communications to and from the United States. It
                is responsible for regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and
                cable. The task of the FCC in wireless networking is to regulate the radio signals that are used for wireless
                networking.<br>
                <b>The FCC and the respective controlling agencies in the other countries typically regulate two categories
                    of wireless communications:-</b>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Licensed spectrum</b> require an approved license application and the financial costs are very high.</li>
                    <li><b>Unlicensed spectrum</b> no require license application, no financial costs it's free,The main disadvantage to transmitting in an unlicensed frequency band is that anyone else can also
                        transmit in that same frequency space.Unlicensed frequency bands are often very crowded; therefore, transmissions from other individuals can
                        cause interference with your transmissions.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, commonly known as the IEEE, is a global professional society
                with more than 400,000 members.</p>

            <h3>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</h3>
            <p>It is an international community of people in the networking industry whose goal is to make the Internet work
                Better. The mission of the IETF, as defined by the organization in a document known as RFC3935, is “to produce high

            <h3>Wi-Fi Alliance</h3>
            <p>The Wi-Fi Alliance is a <b>global, nonprofit industry association of more than 350 member companies devoted to
                promoting the growth of WLANs.</b> One of the primary tasks of the Wi-Fi Alliance is to market the Wi-Fi brand and
                raise consumer awareness of new 802.11 technologies as they become available.
                The Wi-Fi Alliances main task is to ensure the interoperability of WLAN products by providing certification testing.
                The Wi-Fi Alliance, originally named the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA), was founded in August
                1999. The name was changed to the Wi-Fi Alliance in October 2002.

            <h3>Radio frequency fundamentals</h3>
            <p><b>Bounded medium</b> contains or confines
                the signal (small amounts of signal leakage can occur). <b>Unbounded medium</b> does not contain the signal, which is free to radiate into the
                atmosphere in all directions (unless restricted or redirected by some outside influence).</p>
            
            <h3>Definition of RF(Radio frequency) signals</h3>
            <p><b></b>The <b>electro magnetic(EM) spectrum</b> which is usually simply referred to as spectrum, is the range of all possible
                electromagnetic radiation. This radiation exists as self-propagating electromagnetic waves that can move
                through matter or space. <b>Examples of electromagnetic waves include:-</b> gamma rays, X-rays, visible light and radio
                waves. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves occurring on the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic
                spectrum.An <b>RF signal starts</b> out as an electrical alternating current(AC) signal that is originally generated by a transmitter.This AC signal is sent through a copper conductor (typically a coaxial cable) and radiated out of an antenna element
                in the form of an electromagnetic wave. This electromagnetic wave is the wireless signal. Changes of electron flow in
                an antenna, otherwise known as current, produce changes in the electromagnetic fields around the antenna.An alternating current is an electrical current with a magnitude and direction that varies cyclically, as opposed to
                direct current, the direction of which stays in a constant form. The shape and form of the AC signal—defined as the
                waveform—is what is known as a sine wave. <b>Sine wave</b> patterns can also be seen in light,
                sound and the ocean. The fluctuation of voltage in an AC current is known as cycling, or oscillation. </p>

                        <li><b>Phase</b> is not a property of just one RF signal but instead involves the relationship between two or more signals that
                            share the same frequency.Phase can be measured in distance, time, or degrees. If the peaks of two signals with the same frequency are in
                            exact alignment at the same time, they are said to be <b>in phase.</b> if frequency are not in exact alignment at the same time, they are said to be <b>out of phase.</b></li>

                <p>
                    <ul class="listno">
                        <li><b>Wave propagation</b> The way in which the RF waves move known as wave propagation.The manner in which a wireless signal moves is often referred to as propagation behavior.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Absorption</b>  If a signal does not bounce off an object, move around an object, or
                            pass through an object, then 100 percent absorption has occurred.Absorption is a leading cause of
                            attenuation(loss)</li>
                        <li><b>Reflection</b> When a wave hits a smooth object
                            that is larger than the wave itself it's occure reflection behaviors.
                            <b>Two types of reflections:-</b>
                            <ul class="kb">
                                <li><b>Sky wave reflection</b> can
                                    occur in frequencies below 1 GHz, where the signal has a very large wavelength.</li>
                                <li><b>Microwave reflection</b> exist between 1 GHz and 300 GHz. Because they are higher frequency signals, they
                                    have much smaller wavelengths.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Scattering</b> can most easily be described as multiple reflections. These multiple reflections occur when the
                            electromagnetic signals wavelength is larger than pieces of whatever medium the signal is reflecting from or passing
                            through.
                            <b>Scattering can happen in two ways:-</b>
                            <ul class="kb">
                                <li>The first type of scatter is on a smaller level and has a lesser effect on the signal
                                    quality and strength</li>
                                <li>The second type of scattering occurs when an RF signal encounters some type of uneven surface and is reflected
                                    into multiple directions</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Refraction</b>  being absorbed or bounced (via reflection or scattering).Fraction most commonly occurs as a result of atmospheric conditions.
                            <b>The three most common causes of refraction</b> are water vapor, changes in air temperature and changes in air pressure.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Diffraction</b> is the bending of an RF signal around an object.Sitting directly behind the obstruction is an area known as the <b>RF shadow.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Loss or attenuation</b> decrease of amplitude, or signal strength.</li>
                        <li><b>Free space path loss(FSPL)</b> is the loss of
                            signal strength caused by the natural broadening of the waves, often referred to as beam divergence.</li>
                        <li><b>Multipath</b> is a propagation phenomenon that results in two or more paths of a signal arriving at a receiving antenna
                            at the same time or within nanoseconds of each other.<br>
                            <b>The four possible results of multipath are as follows:-</b>
                            <ul class="kb">
                                <li><b>Upfade</b> This is increased signal strength. When the multiple RF signal paths arrive at the receiver at the same time.</li>
                                <li><b>Downfade</b> This is decreased signal strength. When the multiple RF signal paths arrive at the receiver at the same
                                    time.</li>
                                <li><b>Nulling</b> This is signal cancellation. When the multiple RF signal paths arrive at the receiver at the same time and are
                                    180 degrees out of phase with the primary wave.</li>
                                <li><b>Data corruption</b> The delay spread, along with the fact that there may be multiple reflected signals, the receiver can have problems
                                    demodulating the RF signals information.</li>

                        <li><b>Gain or amplification</b> the increase of amplitude, or signal strength.

                <h3>WLANs and the SSID</h3>
                <p>When building a wireless network, it is important to make sure that the wireless components connect to the
                    appropriate WLAN. This is done using a Service Set Identifier (SSID).
                    The SSID is a case-sensitive, alpha-numeric string that is up to 32-characters. It is sent in the header of all frames
                    transmitted over the WLAN. The SSID is used to tell wireless devices which WLAN they belong to and with which
                    other devices they can communicate. </p>

                        <li><b>Ad-hoc</b> is the simplest form of a wireless network is created by <b>connecting two or more wireless clients together in a peer to peer network.</b> Ad-hoc network and does not include an
                            AP. All clients within an ad-hoc network are equal.</li>
                        <li><b>Infrastructure mode</b> in larger networks require <b> a single device that
                            controls communications</b> in the wireless cell. If present, an AP will take over this role and control who can talk and
                            when this is known as infrastructure mode. Individual STAs cannot communicate directly with each
                            other. To communicate, each device must obtain permission from the AP.The AP controls all communications and
                            ensures that all STAs have equal access to the medium. The area covered by a single AP is known as a Basic Service
                            Set (BSS) or cell.<br>The Basic Service Set(BSS) is the smallest building block of a WLAN. The area of coverage of a single AP is limited. To
                            expand the coverage area, it is possible to connect multiple BSSs through a Distribution System (DS).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Wireless channels</h3>
                <p><b>Channels</b> are created by dividing up the available RF spectrum. Each channel is capable of carrying a different
                    conversation.Wireless technology uses an access method called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
                    (CSMA/CA).CSMA/CA creates a reservation on the channel for use by a specific conversation. While a reservation is
                    in place, no other device may transmit on the channel thus possible collisions are avoided.
                </p>

                <h3>Limiting access to a WLAN</h3>
                <p>One way to limit access to your wireless network is to control exactly which devices can gain access to your network.
                    This can be accomplished through filtering of the MAC address.
                    <ul class="kb">
                        <li><b>MAC address filtering:</b> uses the MAC address to identify which devices are allowed to connect to the wireless
                            network.</li>
                        <li><b>Implement authentication:</b> Authentication is the process of permitting
                            entry to a network based on a set of credentials. It is used to verify that the device attempting to connect to the
                            network is trusted.</li>
                        <li><b>Pre-shared keys(PSK):</b> both the AP and client must be configured with the same secret word.</li>
                        <li><b>Extensible Authentication Protocol(EAP):</b> provides two-way authentication as well as user authentication. When EAP software is installed on
                            the client, the client communicates with a backend authentication server such as Remote Authentication Dial-in
                            User Service (RADIUS).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Encryption on a WLAN</h3>
                <p><b>Encryption</b> is the process of transforming data.</p> 
                
                <p><b>Wired Equivalency Protocol(WEP)</b> is an advanced security feature that encrypts network traffic as it travels through
                            the air.However, there are weaknesses within WEP,
                            including the use of a static key on all WEP enabled devices.</p>
                <p><b>Wi-Fi Protected Access(WPA)</b> also uses encryption keys from 64 bits up to 256 bits. However, WPA, unlike WEP, generates new, dynamic
                    keys each time a client establishes a connection with the AP. For this reason, WPA is considered more secure than
                    WEP because it is significantly more difficult to crack.</p>

                <h3>Traffic filtering on a WLAN</h3>
                <p>In addition to controlling who can gain access to the WLAN and who can make use of transmitted data, it is also
                    worthwhile to control the types of traffic transmitted across a WLAN. This is accomplished using traffic filtering.
                    Traffic filtering blocks undesirable traffic from entering or leaving the wireless network. Filtering is done by the AP as
                    traffic passes through it. It can be used to remove traffic from, or destined to, a specific MAC or IP address. It can
                    also block certain applications by port numbers. By removing unwanted, undesirable and suspicious traffic from the
                    network.</p>

                <h3>Connecting multiple access points together through Wireless Distribution System(WDS)</h3>
                <p>Wireless Distribution System(WDS) lets you connect multiple access points together. WDS allows the connected
                    access points to communicate with each other via wireless connection.</p>
                
                <h3>Privacy</h3>
                <p>The condition that is achieved by successfully maintaining the confidentiality of personal, student,
                    employee transmitted over a wireless network.
                </p>
                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>Security is particularly important in wireless networks because data is transmitted using radio
                    signals that, without implementation of specific data encryption mechanisms, can easily be
                    intercepted.
