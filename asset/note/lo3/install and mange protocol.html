            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Security(cryptographic protocol)</h3>
            <p>Work to ensure the network and the data sent over it are protected from unauthorized users.
                <br><b>Common function of securing network protocol</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Encryption</b> protect data and secure areas by requiring users to input a secret key or password to access information.</li>
                    <li><b>Entity authentication</b> create a system that regular different devices or user on a network to verify their identify before accessing secure area.</li>
                    <li><b>Transportation</b> its transported from one network device to other network device.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Common network protocols</h3>

            <h3>Common network protocol application</h3>
            <ul class="cc">
                <li><b>ARP(address resolution protocol)</b> is a communication layer protocol it mapping process between the data link layer and network layer which is used to identify a media access control(MAC) address given the IP address.</li>
                <li><b>DNS(domain name system)</b> is a hierarchical system that convert these ip addresses into a human readable host name.</li>
                <li><b>FTP(file transfer protocol)</b> is a network protocol on the client and server modes architecture used to transfer files between the client and server on a computer network.</li>
                <li><b>IMAP(internet message access protocol)</b> is an internet email protocol that store email on the mail server and allow the end user to retrieve, see and manipulate the message as they were stored locally on the user device. Denial of service(DOS) attack can also be carried out on the email server which result in unrecived and unsent emails.</li>
                <li><b>SMB(server message block protocol)</b></li>
                <li><b>RDP(remote desktop protocol)</b> is a protocol that provide users with a geographical interface to connect to other computer over a network connect with when one user runs RDP client software while an other run RDP server software.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Network layer</h3>
            <p>Network layer is part of internet communication process where these connection occur by sending packet of data between different network.<br>
            <b>Function of network layer</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Breaking up segment into network packets</li>

                    <li>Routing packet by discovering the best path across a physical network.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Goal of protocols</h3>

            <p><b>Static IP address</b> are created manually.<br>
            <b>Dynamic IP address</b> are typically assigned by DHCP.</p>

            <h3>Protocol divided into two such as:-</h3>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>Standard protocol</b> is a mandatory protocol for all devices if support s multiple decive and act as standard. Standard protocls are <b>not vendor specific.</b> 
                    <br><b>Some example standard protocols</b>
                    <ul class="kb">

                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ip address class</h3>
            <p>The first step in planning for ip addressing on your network is to determine which network class in appropriate for your network.
            There are classes of tcp/ip network each class uses the 32bit ip addresses space differently.
            <br><b>These class are:-</b>
            <ul class="cc">
                <li><b>Class A</b>
                    <p>Class A network is the first 8 bits of the ip address as it's. Network part the remaining 24bit comprise the host part of the ip address. The value asigned to the first bytes of Class a network number all with the range 0 - 127. All 127 class A network can exist.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Class B</b>
                                <p>Class B network number uses 16 bits for network number and 16 bits for the host number. The first byte of class B network number is in the range of 128 - 191.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Class C</b>
                                <p>Class C network number  use 24 bit for network number and 8 bit for the host number. The first byte of class C network number  is in the range 192 - 223. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Ip address</h3>
            <p>Ip address is a logical address that is assigned to every single computer that is a part of TCP/IP based network.</p>
            <h3>Subnet</h3>
            <p>Subnet is a separate and identifiable portion of an organization network typically arranged for one floor, building or geographical.</p>
            <h3>Subnet mask</h3>
            <p>Subnet mask is a 32 bit number used to differentiate the network component of an Ip address by dividing the Ip address.</p>
