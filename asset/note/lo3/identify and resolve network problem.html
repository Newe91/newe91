            <h3>What is network monitoring?</h3>
            <p>Network monitoring refers to the practice of overseeing the operation of a computer
                network using specialized management software tools. 
                <b>Network monitoring allows</b> network managers to collect and analyze network activity statistics in order
                to be better informed so that they can make sound management decision.<br>
                Network security monitors or detectors monitor and alert of any suspicious or malicious
                activity on the network such as:- Intrusions,Attacks and breaches. 
            </p>
