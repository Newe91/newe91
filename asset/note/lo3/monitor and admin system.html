            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <h3>Control user accounts</h3>
            <p><b>User</b> is an individual who uses a computer system, resources or application
                <br><b>User account</b> defines the actions a user can perform in Windows. On a stand-alone computer or
                a computer that is a member of a workgroup, a user account establishes the privileges assigned to
                each user. On a computer that is part of a network domain, a user must be a member of at least
                one group. The permissions and rights granted to a group are assigned to its members. User
                accounts on a computer that is a member of a network domain.</p>
            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of people who are attempting to
                access the network or system. This is usually the first step in gaining access to a
                computer system. A process of determining what activities or access will be permitted
                for user. This may include access to network resources, data and applications.</p>

            <h3>Strong passwords</h3>
            <p>Computer security includes the use of strong passwords for your network logon and the
                Administrator account on your computer. For a password to be strong, it should: Be at least
                seven characters long. Because of the way passwords are encrypted, the most secure passwords
                are seven or 14 characters long. And also the password must contain uppercase(ABC...), lowercase(abc...),numbers(1,2,3...) and also symbols(!,@,#...). </p>
            
            <h3>Network security</h3>
            <p>Network security is the prevention and protection of network assets from unauthorized access,
                use, alteration, degradation, destruction and other threats. It involves the authorization of access
                to data in a network which is controlled by the network administrator and the organization
                policies. Users choose or an ID and password or authenticating information that allows them
                access to information and program within their authority. It also covers a variety of computer
                networks, both public and private, that are used in everyday jobs conducting transactions and
                communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals Networks can be
                private, such as within a company, and others which might be open to public access. Network
                security is involved in organizations, enterprises, and other types of institutions. It does as its title
                explains: It secures the network, as well as protecting and overseeing operations being done.
            </p>

            <h3>Group policy</h3>
            <p>Group policy is a User Account Control; helps to protect the systems even though a user is
                logged on as an administrator.</p>

            <h3>User accounts and computer accounts</h3>
            <p>Active Directory user accounts and computer accounts represent a physical entity such as a
                computer or person. User accounts can also be used as dedicated service accounts for some
                applications.<br>
                User accounts and computer accounts(as well as groups) are also referred to as security
                principals. Security principals are directory objects that are automatically assigned security IDs
                which can be used to access domain resources.
                <br><b>User or computer account is used to:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Authenticate the identity of a user or computer</li>
                    <li>Authorize or deny access to domain resources</li>
                    <li>Administer other security principals</li>
                    <li>Audit actions performed using the user or computer account</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Defining group</h3>
            <p>A group can be defined as a collection of accounts that are grouped together so that
                Administrators can assign permissions and rights to the group as a single entity. This removes
                the need for an Administrator to individually assign permissions and rights to each account.
                Therefore, while a user account is associated with an individual or entity, a group account or a
                group is created to simplify the administration of multiple user accounts (users). When
                permissions are granted to a group, all accounts that are part of that particular group are granted
                the permissions. Permissions actually control which actions users can perform on a network
                resource. Rights, on the other hand, relate to system tasks.<br>
                Windows Server 2003 provides user accounts and group accounts (of which users can be a
                member). User accounts are designed for individuals. Group accounts are designed to make the
                administration of multiple users easier.
            </p>

            <h3>Group types</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Security groups</b>
                        <p>A security group is a collection of users who have the same permissions to
                            resources and the same rights to perform certain system tasks. These are the groups to which
                            permissions are assigned so that its members can access resources. Security groups therefore
                            remove the need for an Administrator to individually assign permissions to users. Users that
                            need to perform certain tasks can be grouped in a security group then assigned the necessary
                            permissions to perform these tasks. Each user that is a member of the group has the same
                            permissions. In addition to this, each group member receives any e-mail sent to a security
                            group. When a security group is first created, it receives an SID (security ID). It is this SID
                            that enables permissions to be assigned to security groups.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Distribution groups</b>
                        <p>Distribution groups are created to share information with a group of
                            users through e-mail messages. Thus, a distribution group is not created for security
                            purposes. A distribution does not obtain an SID when it is created. Distribution groups enable
                            the same message to be simultaneously sent to its group members. Messages do not need to
                            be individually sent to each user. Applications such as Microsoft Exchange that work with
                            Active Directory can use distribution groups to send bulk e-mail to groups of users.
                            </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Global groups</b>
                        <p>Global groups are containers for user accounts and computers accounts in
                            the domain. They assign permissions to objects that reside in any domain in a tree or
                            forest. Users can include a global group in the access control list (ACL) of objects in any
                            domain in the tree/forest. A global group can, however, only have members from the
                            domain in which it is created. What this means is that a global group cannot include user
                            accounts, computer accounts and global groups from other domains.<br>
                            <b>The default global groups that are created are listed below:</b>
                            <ul class="kb">

                                <li><b>Domain Users:</b> Group members are user accounts that are created in the domain.</li>
                                <li><b>Domain Computers:</b> Group members are computer accounts that are created in the
                                    domain. This includes all workstations and servers that are part of the domain.</li>
                                <li><b>Domain Controllers:</b> Group members are domain controllers of the domain.</li>

                        <b>Domain local groups</b>
                        <p>Domain local groups can have user accounts, computer accounts,
                            global groups, and universal groups from any domain as group members. However, only
                            domain local groups can assign permissions to local resources or to resources that reside
                            in the domain in which the domain local group was created.<br>
                            <b>The default domain local groups that are created are listed below:-</b>

                                    </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Universal groups</b>
                        <p>Universal groups can have user accounts, computer accounts, global
                            groups, and other universal groups from any domain in the tree or forest as members. This
                            basically means that users can add members from any domain in the forest to a universal group.
                            Users can use universal groups to assign permissions to access resources that are located in any
                            domain in the forest. Universal groups are only available when the domain functional level for
                            the domain is Windows 2000 Native or Windows Server 2003. Universal groups are not
                            available when domains are functioning in the Windows 2000 Mixed domain functional level.
                            Users can convert a universal group to a global group or to a domain local group if the particular
                            universal group has no other universal group as a group member. When adding members to
                            universal groups, it is recommended to add global groups as members and not individual users.<br>
                            <b>The default universal groups that are created are listed below:-</b>

            <h3>When formulating a strategy for setting up domain local groups and global groups, follow the
                guidelines listed below:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Add users that perform the same function in the organization to a global group.</li>
                    <li>Domain local groups should be created for a resources that multiple users need to share.</li>
                    <li>Add any global groups that have to access a resources to the appropriate domain local
                        group.</li>
                    <li>The domain local group should be assigned with the proper permissions to the resource.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Define group policy object</h3>
            <p>Group policy is a set of rules that control the working environment of user accounts and computer
                accounts. Group Policy provides the centralized management and configuration of operating
                systems, applications and users settings in an Active Directory environment. In other words,
                Group Policy in part controls what users can and cannot do on a computer system.</p>

            <h3>Group policy can help you do the following:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Configure user's desktops</li>
                    <li>Configure local security on computers</li>
                    <li>Install applications</li>
                    <li>Run logon or logoff scripts</li>
                    <li>Configure internet eExplorer settings</li>
                    <li>Redirect special folders</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Local policy</h3>
            <p>Local policy refers to the policy that configures the local computer or server, and is not
                inherited from the domain. You can set local policy by running gpedit.msc from the Run
                command, or you can add "Group Policy Object Editor" snap-in to MMC. Local Policies also
                exist in the Active Directory environment, but have many fewer configuration options that the
                full-fledged Group Policy in Active Directory.</p>

            <h3>Group policy object(GPO)</h3>
            <p>Group policy object refers to the policy that is configured at the Active Directory
                level and is inherited by the domain member computers. You can configure a Group
                Policy Object - at the site level, domain level or Organization Unit level.
            </p>

            <h3>Managing and administering network resources</h3>
            <p>Network management refers to the activities, methods, procedures, and tools relevant to the
                operation, administration, maintenance, and provisioning of networked systems. A network
                administrator, network analyst or network engineer is a person responsible for the
                maintenance of computer hardware and software that comprises a computer network. This
                normally includes deploying, configuring, maintaining and monitoring active network
                equipment.</p>

            <h3>Network resource access permission</h3>
            <p>Network resource should accessible for only authenticated users and users should manipulate the resources based on the level of permission
                given for them by the network administrator. In order to protect the resources that are made
                available through shared folders, administrators must configure “permissions” for the folders and
                files that are made available over the network.<br> <b>Permissions include:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Full control</b> Permits reading, writing, changing
                        and deleting of the file.</li>
                    <li><b>Modify</b> Permits reading and writing of the
                        file and also allows deletion of the file, can't change the file.</li>
                    <li><b>Read and execute</b> Permits viewing and accessing of
                        the file's contents as well as
                        executing of the file, can't modify and delete.</li>
                    <li><b>Read</b> Permits viewing or accessing of the
                        file's contents.</li>
                    <li><b>Write</b> Permits writing to a file.</li>
                    <li><b>List folder contents</b> Can't access the file by anyway.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Connecting and configuring network printer</h3>
            <p>If you have multiple computers that need to share one printer, then you need to know how to
                configure a print server. A print server is most often a single computer set up to handle print jobs
                sent to one or more printers from several other computers. By setting up one computer as the
                server, you allow any computer sharing the network to send and print documents utilizing the
                same printer.</p>

            <h3>Planning and implementing security</h3>
            <p><b>Security</b> refers to the measures taken to protect certain things or elements of information. There
                are three main elements:-<b>Confidentiality,Integrity and Availability.</b></p>

            <h3>Security policy should contain some important function:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>The security policy must be understandable</li>
                    <li>The security policy must be realistic</li>
                    <li>The security policy must be consistent</li>
                    <li>The security policy must be enforceable</li>
                    <li>The security policy must be documented, distributed and communicated properly</li>
                    <li>A successful security policy needs to be flexible</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Planning your security policy</h3>
            <p>There are three factors to keep in mind when planning your policy. The first requires you to
                express the goals of your policy. What are you trying to accomplish? What are you trying to
                protect? The second step requires you to scan the work environment and identify vulnerabilities
                that exist within current processes. The final step asks you to create a plan of action that will help
                alleviate the faults. All are equal contributors to planning success.
                <br><b>Step to make planning security policy:-</b>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li>
                        <b>Setting goals for your security policy</b>
                        <p>Your security policy goals should run parallel with the goals set for your company. For example,
                            if your company is customer oriented, then a goal of your security policy should be to protect
                            your customer and their data through use of encryption and network security. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Identifying security vulnerabilities</b>
                        <p>A company must examine existing procedures and identify all processes that pose a security risk.
                            For example, policies regarding data management; how data is protected during storage, how
                            long it is kept and proper methods for data deletion are common pains in the corporate world.
                            <br><b>Some questions that may help identify such vulnerability include:-</b>
                            <ul class="kb">
                                <li>What types of sensitive information does your company handle?</li>
                                <li>Which department handles each piece of sensitive information?</li>
                                <li>Is sensitive information stored with non-sensitive information</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Creating a plan of action</b>
                        <p>After identifying which processes require change, create a plan of action for mitigating these
                            risks. Each plan should consider how long it will take for the each change to occur, what type of
                            training is necessary for each individual/department to meet the newly adopted standards and
                            also what responsibilities each individual/department can be held accountable for (i.e. how often
                            are gap analyses regarding security conducted and who conducts them.</p>
                    </li>

                policy may include an acceptable use policy, a description of how the company plans to
                educate its employees about protecting the company's assets, an explanation of how security
                measurements will be carried out and enforced and a procedure for evaluating the
                effectiveness of the security policy to ensure that necessary corrections will be made.

                    <li>It performs periodic scans of every file on the compute</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Anti-virus software will not protect you against:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Programs that you choose to install that may contain unwanted features</li>
                    <li>Spam</li>
                    <li>Against any kind of fraud or criminal activity online</li>
                    <li>A hacker trying break into your computer over the internet.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Standalone anti-virus or security suite</h3>
            <p>Most anti-virus software companies sell a standalone program that only scans for viruses as well
                as security suite packages that include other protective software such as a firewall, spam
                filtering, anti-spyware and so on.<br><b>Advantages of a suite:</b> a suite should cover all the bases, share a single user interface and
                be easier and cheaper than buying each individual program separately. 
            </p>

            <h3>Free or commercial antivirus</h3>
            <p>There are a number of anti-virus products that are free for personal or non-commercial use.
                In most cases, these ‘free’ products are scaled-back versions of commercial products to which
                the software manufacturer hopes you will, one day, upgrade. Unless getting free software is
                critical, it is preferable to buy a fully-supported commercial product.</p>

            <h3>How to evaluate anti-virus software main criteria are such as:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Price</li>
                    <li>Review on reputable technical websites</li>
                    <li>How easy it is to set up and use</li>
                    <li>Level and quality of technical support, including the support website</li>
                    <li>Frequency and responsiveness of signature updates. This is hard for most people to
                        evaluate but well-known and reputable software companies should be okay</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>How to buy anti-virus software</h3>
            <p>Then it is a matter of buying it or downloading it. Suppliers include: high street retailers, online
                retailers or direct purchase and download from the software developers over the internet.</p>
            
            <h3>Business anti-virus software</h3>
            <p>For networks of five or more computers and for business use, you should consider business
                versions of popular anti-virus software that are designed to make installation, updating and
                management easier on multiple computers.</p>

            <h3>Many companies use commercial anti-virus software such as:-</h3>
            <p>

            <h3>Virus protection advice</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li> Do not open any files attached to an email from an unknown, doubtful or untrustworthy
                        source, no matter how charming it may seem.</li>
                    <li>Switch on macro protection in Microsoft Office applications like Word and Excel.</li>
                    <li>You don't have to use the anti-virus program that came with your new computer but if
                        you decide to stick with it, don't forget to subscribe once the free trial period is over so
                        that you stay up-to-date.</li>
                    <li>Only use one anti-virus program at a time. Uninstall one anti-virus program before you
                        install another.</li>
                    <li>Providing you update virus signatures regularly, as a general rule, you don't need to buy
                        every single new release of the anti-virus software to stay protected.</li>
                    <li>Free online scans are useful diagnostic tools but they are not a substitute for a proper antivirus program that is installed on your PC. Prevention is better than cure.</li>
                </ul>
