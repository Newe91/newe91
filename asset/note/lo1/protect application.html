            <h2>Unit 1: Controlling ensures user accounts</h2>
            <p>A <b>user accounts</b> allows you to sign in to your computer.</p>
            <h3>User Account Control</h3>
            <p>We do want our users to access the system; it's just that we want them to have the appropriate access. The control of user access can take many forms and apply at several levels. Once a computer is physically accessed, the user usually logs on to gain access to applications.
                <ul class="listno"><b>We can simplify the process down to 3 things:-</b>
                    <li>Physical access</li>
                    <li>Authentication</li>
                    <li>Authorisation</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>1.Physical access</h3>
            <p>The first layer of management and security is the physical access to the computer. 
                <b>To prevent unauthorized access, a company may make use of:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Locks on the front doors</li>
                    <li>Security guards</li>
                    <li>Cameras</li>
                    <li>Keys on computer systems and etc...</li>
                </ul>  
            </p>

            <h3>2.Authentication</h3>
            <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of people who are attempting to access the network or system.
                <ul class="kb"><b>The most common method used to authenticate users:-</b>
                    <li>Username</li>
                    <li>Password</li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="kb"><b>Other authentication methods include:-</b>
                    <li><b>Username with static passwords:</b> the password stays the same until changed by the user at some time </li>
                    <li><b>Usernames with dynamic passwords:</b> the password is constantly changed by a password generator synchronized with the user and system</li>
                    <li><b>Other challenge response systems:</b> this may involve PINs, questions to the user requiring various answers or actions </li>
                    <li><b>Certificate based:</b> this requires the user to have an electronic certificate or token. This may also need to be digitally signed by a trusted authority</li>
                    <li><b>Physical devices:</b> these include the use of smartcards and biometrics. Generally, the entire authentication process occurs on the local workstation, thus eliminating the need for a special server</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>3.Authorisation</h3>
            <p>Once a user has been authenticated (that is their identity validated) they are granted access to the network or system. For the user to then access data or an application or execute some task or command they need be authorized to do so.
                The authorization process <b>determines what the user can do on the network.</b> </p>

            <h3>User account</h3>
            <p><b>A user account is a collection of information that tells Windows which files and folders you can access</b>, what changes you can make to the computer and your personal preferences, such as your desktop background or screen saver. User accounts let you share a computer with several people, while having your own files and settings. Each person accesses his or her user account with a username and password. </p>
            <h3>There are three types of accounts:-</h3>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Standard Account</b>
                        <p>Standard Accounts are for everyday computing.<br>
                            You can use most programs that are installed on the computer and change settings that affect your user account. However, <b>you can't install or uninstall some software and hardware, you can't delete files</b> that are required for the computer to work and you can't change settings that affect other users or the security of the computer. If you're using a standard account, you might be prompted for an administrator password before you can perform certain tasks.
                            <br><b>Why use a Standard User Account instead of an Administrator Account?</b>
                            Because the standard account can help protect your computer by preventing users from making changes that affect everyone who uses the computer, such as deleting files that are required for the computer to work. We recommend creating a standard account for each user. 
                            <br>When you are logged on to Windows with a standard account, you can do almost anything that you can do with an administrator account, but if you want to do something that affects other users of the computer, such as installing software or changing security settings, Windows might ask you to provide a password for an administrator account.                                    
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Administrator Account</b>
                        <p>Administrator Accounts provide the most control over a computer and should only be used when necessary.
                            <br>Administrators <b>can change security settings, install software and hardware and access all files on the computer.</b> Administrators can also make changes to other user accounts.           
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Guest Account</b>
                        <p>Guest Accounts are intended primarily for people who need temporary use of a computer.
                            <br>A guest account allows people to have temporary access to your computer. People using the guest account <b>can't install software or hardware, change settings, or create a password.</b>                                                                                         
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
            <h3>User Profiles </h3>
            <p>User profile is a collection of settings that make the computer look and work the way you want it to. It contains your settings for desktop backgrounds, screen savers, pointer preferences, sound settings and other features.</p>

            <h3>User Account Control(UAC) </h3>
            <p>User Account Control (UAC) is a feature in Windows that can help you stay in control of your computer by informing you when a program makes a change that requires administrator-level permission. UAC works by adjusting the permission level of your user account. If you’re doing tasks that can be done as a standard user, such as reading e-mail, listening to music, or creating documents, you have the permissions of a standard user—even if you’re logged on as an administrator.  
                <br>When changes are going to be made to your computer that requires administrator level permission, UAC notifies you. If you are an administrator, you can click yes to continue. If you are not an administrator, someone with an administrator account on the computer will have to enter their password for you to continue. If you give permission, you are temporarily given the rights of an administrator to complete the task and then your permissions are returned back to that of a standard user. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>Why is User Account Control necessary? </h3>
            <p>Most users do not require such a high level of access to the computer. Often users are unaware that they are logged on as an administrator when they browse the Web, check e-mail and run software. While logging on with an administrator account enables a user to install legitimate software, the user can also unintentionally or intentionally install a malicious program. A malicious program installed by an administrator can fully compromise the computer and affect all users. 
                <br>With the introduction of UAC, the access control model changed to help mitigate the impact of a malicious program. When a user attempts to start an administrator application, the User Account Control dialog box asks the user to click Yes or No before the user's full administrator access token can be used. If the user is not an administrator, the user must provide an administrator's credentials to run the program. 
                Because UAC requires an administrator to approve application installations, unauthorized applications cannot be installed automatically or without the explicit consent of an administrator. 
            </p>

            <h3>User Account Settings  </h3>
            <p>
                <b>Consider when setting up user account options:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Password requirements:</b> whether a password is required, minimum length, complexity, needs to be changed at intervals, etc...</li>
                    <li><b>Account lock out settings:</b> disabling accounts that have made a number of bad logon attempts </li>
                    <li><b>Access hours:</b> the standard days and time that users will be permitted to access the network  </li>
                    <li><b>Account expiry dates</b> date when account will be disabled </li>
                    <li><b>Logon restrictions:</b> accounts can only be used at specified locations or workstations</li>
                    <li><b>Home directory information:</b> a home directory is a folder that usually has the name of the user and the user has full permissions over</li>
                    <li><b>Logon scripts:</b> these perform specific tasks or run specific programs when the user logs on  </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Use of Groups </h3>
            <p>The most common way of administering access permissions is to create groups and put user accounts into appropriate groups. The group is then permitted or denied access as required. Using groups is an efficient way of managing authorisation because you only need to set access permission to a group and not individual accounts.</p>

            <h3>Permissions and Rights </h3>
            <p>Permissions generally refer to file and directory access.Rights (or privileges) generally refer to the restriction on user accounts or group in performing some task or activity. For example a user account or group may be assigned administrator or supervisor rights meaning that the user can perform administration tasks like create, modify or delete user accounts.
                <b>The user account or group can be set with the following type of permissions:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>No access</b></li>
                    <li><b>Read only</b></li>
                    <li><b>Modify</b> where the contents of files and directories may be accesses but changed or added to but not deleted </li>
                    <li><b>Full Control</b> where files and directories can be view modified and deleted</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Identifying Logon Restrictions </h3>
            <p>Logon restrictions include locking accounts after several incorrect attempts at typing a password, allowing users to log on only during specific hours, requiring users to change their passwords regularly, disabling accounts and accounts that expire on a specific date. 
                <br><b>Types of logon restrictions:-</b>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Account Lockout</b>
                        <p>If a user provides incorrect credentials several times in a row (for example, if an attacker is attempting to guess a user’s password, or if a user repeatedly mistypes a password), Windows can block all authentication attempts for a specific amount of time. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Logon Hour Restrictions</b>
                        <p>Administrators can also use the Account tab of an AD DS user’s properties to restrict logon hours.
                            If a user attempts to log on outside his allowed hours, displays the error message “Your account has time restrictions that prevent you from logging on at this time. Please try again later.”
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Password Expiration</b>
                        <p>If users attempt to log on interactively to a computer and their password has expired, Windows prompts them to change their password automatically.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Disabled Account</b>
                        <p>Administrators can disable user accounts to prevent a user from logging on.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Account Expiration </b>
                        <p>Accounts can be configured to expire. This is useful for users who will be working with an organization for only a limited amount of time. For example, if a contract employee has a two-week contract, domain administrators might set an account expiration date of two weeks in the future. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Password </h3>
            <p>A password is a string of characters that people can use to log on to a computer and access files, programs and other resources.
                Passwords help ensure that people do not access the computer unless they have been authorized to do so.To help keep your computer secure, you should always create a strong password.  
            </p>
            <h3>Strong passwords and passphrases</h3>
            <p>Passwords and passphrases help prevent unauthorized people from accessing files.
                A password is a string of characters used to access information or a computer. Passphrases are typically longer than passwords, for added security and contain multiple words that create a phrase.
            </p>

            <h3>Modify User Security Policy </h3>
            <b>Password</b> is a strings of character  that can people use to log on a computer or access a file.<br>
            <p><b>Password policy</b> is a set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them properly.
                <b>Some policies suggest or impose requirements on what type of password a user can choose, such as:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Use of both upper and lower-case letters(case sensitivity)</li>
                    <li>Use one or more numerical digits</li>
                    <li>Use special characters, e.g. @, #, $ etc... </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Common Password Practice </h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Never use the same password for more than one account </li>
                    <li>Never tell a password to anyone</li>
                    <li>Being careful to log off before leaving</li>
                    <li>Changing passwords whenever there is suspicion they may have been </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Password </h3>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li><b>System Password:</b> does the password appear as the computer is booting? If yes, this is a BIOS or CMOS password. BIOS or CMOS passwords will not allow the computer to be boot at all unless the password is known. </li>
                <li><b>Operating System /Network/ Third-Party Password:</b> does the password appear after the computer is done booting and before the operating system runs? If yes, this is a network, Operating System, or third party password. </li>
                <li><b>Window Password:</b> Windows users, does the password appear in Windows before the desktop? If yes, this is a Windows or Windows network password. If you are able to press the Escape key and get to Windows, you have a standard Windows password; however, if this does not bypass the password prompt, it is likely you have a Windows network password. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Enforce Password History in Group Policy Editor</h3>
            <p>When the "Enforce password history" policy setting is enabled, Windows keeps a record of a specified number of prior user account passwords. When users change their account password, they are prohibited from re-using any of the passwords still in the Windows memory. This policy helps to enhance computer security. By default, the "Enforce password history" policy is set to "0," which means no prior passwords are remembered. To enable the "Enforce password history" policy, the setting has to be a value greater than 0. </p>
            
            <h3>Assign Minimum and Maximum Password Age</h3>
            <p><b>Minimum Password Age:</b> The minimum password age must be less than the Maximum password age, unless the maximum password age is set to 0, indicating that passwords will never expire.</p>
            <p><b>Maximum Password Age:</b> This security setting determines the period of time (in days) that a password can be used before the system requires the user to change it. You can set passwords to expire after a number of days between 1 and 999, or you can specify that passwords never expire by setting the number of days to 0.</p>
            <h3>Password Complexity Requirements</h3>
            <p>This security setting determines whether passwords must meet complexity requirements. Complexity requirements are enforced when passwords are changed or created. 
                For example when we create password-->@abcD23;
            </p>

            <h3>Windows supports a variety of authentication techniques including :-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li>The traditional user name and password</li>  
                    <li>Smart cards</li> 
                    <li>Third-party authentication components</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Use auditing </h3>
            <p>By default, Windows 7 does not add an event to the event log when a user provides incorrect credentials (such as when a user mistypes a password). Therefore, when troubleshooting authentication problems, your first step should be to enable auditing for logon events so that you can gather more information about the credentials the user provided and the resource being accessed. 
            </p>

            <h2>Unit 2: Detect and remove destructive software</h2>
            <h3>Definition of Virus</h3>
            <p>A virus is a program that can <b>infect other programs by modifying them to include a possibly
                evolved copy of itself.</b>
            </p>

            <h3>Destructive software</h3>
            <p>Destructive software is referred to as malware(malicious software) and the term includes viruses, worms, logic bombs, rootkits, Trojan horses, adware, keystroke loggers and spyware. Malware is software designed to infiltrate a computer system without the owner's informed consent; hostile, intrusive, or annoying software. 
            <br>Data-stealing malware is a threat that divests victims of personal or proprietary information with the intent of monetizing stolen data through direct use or distribution. This type of malware includes key loggers, screen scrapers, spyware, adware, backdoors and bots. Malware's most common pathway from criminals or malicious developers to users is through the Internet: primarily by email and the World Wide Web. 
            </p>

            <h3>Common types of distractive software</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Trojan horses</b>
                        <p>The Trojan horse program is activated by some specific event, such as the arrival of a certain date, or
                            by a user running a program that has been replaced by the Trojan horse.
                            Trojan horses are programs that an intruder plants on one or more servers in your network. If you
                            have these types of programs, they can be difficult to detect, because many use the same
                            filename as a file that is already part of your operating system or application software. 
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Worms</b>
                        <p>Worms are usually considered to be self-propagating programs that travel through email as well
                            as by other means. A worm will replicate itself by sending copies of the software to all or most
                            of the addresses in your email address book. <b>Examples of worms:</b> Examples of worms include: PSWBugbear.B, Lovgate.F, Trile.C, Sobig.D, Mapson.

                        <b>Resident Viruses</b>
                        <p>This type of virus is a permanent which dwells in the RAM memory. From there it can overcome
                            and interrupt all of the operations executed by the system: corrupting files and programs that are
                            opened, closed, copied, renamed etc. <b>Examples of resident viruses:</b> Randex, CMJ, Meve and MrKlunky.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <b>Direct Action Viruses</b>
                        <p>
                            The main purpose of this virus is to replicate and take action when it is executed. When a
                            specific condition is met, the virus will go into action and infect files in the directory or folder
                            that it is in and in directories that are specified in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file PATH. This batch
                            file is always located in the root directory of the hard disk and carries out certain operations
                            when the computer is booted.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Overwrite Viruses</b>
                        <p>Virus of this kind is characterized by the fact that it deletes the information contained in the files
                            that it infects, rendering them partially or totally useless once they have been infected.
                            The only way to clean a file infected by an overwrite virus is to delete the file completely, thus
                            losing the original content.
                            <b>Examples of overwrite viruses:</b> Way, Trj.Reboot, Trivial.88.D.

                    <li>
                        <b>Boot Virus</b>
                        <p>This type of virus affects the boot sector of a floppy or hard disk. 
                            The best way of avoiding boot viruses is to ensure that floppy disks are write-protected and never
                            start your computer with an unknown floppy disk in the disk drive.
                            <b>Examples of boot viruses:</b> Polyboot.B, AntiEXE.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Macro Virus</b>
                        <p>Macro viruses infect files that are created using certain applications or programs that contain
                            macros. These mini-programs make it possible to automate series of operations so that they are
                            performed as a single action, thereby saving the user from having to carry them out one by one.
                            <b>Examples of macro viruses:</b> Relax, Melissa.A, Bablas, O97M/Y2K.

                        <b>Directory Virus</b>
                        <p>Directory viruses change the paths that indicate the location of a file. By executing a program
                            (file with the extension .EXE or .COM) which has been infected by a virus, you are unknowingly
                            running the virus program, while the original file and program have been previously moved by
                            the virus.Once infected it becomes impossible to locate the original files.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Polymorphic Virus</b>
                        <p>Polymorphic viruses encrypt or encode themselves in a different way (using different algorithms
                            and encryption keys) every time they infect a system.
                            This makes it impossible for anti-viruses to find them using string or signature searches (because
                            they are different in each encryption) and also enables them to create a large number of copies of
                            themselves.
                            <b>Examples of polymorphic viruses:</b> Elkern, Marburg, Satan Bug and Tuareg.

                        <b>File Infectors</b>
                        <p>This type of virus infects programs or executable files (files with an .EXE or .COM extension).
                            When one of these programs is run, directly or indirectly, the virus is activated, producing the
                            damaging effects it is programmed to carry out. The majority of existing viruses belong to this
                            category and can be classified depending on the actions that they carry out.

                        <b>Companion viruses</b>
                        <p>Companion viruses can be considered file infector viruses like resident or direct action types.
                            They are known as companion viruses because once they get into the system they accompany
                            the other files that already exist. In other words, in order to carry out their infection routines,
                            companion viruses can wait in memory until a program is run (resident viruses) or act
                            immediately by making copies of themselves (direct action viruses).
                            <b>Example of companion viruses:</b> Stator, Asimov.1539 and Terrax.1069

                            This type of virus attack can be especially dangerous, by preventing access to certain sections of
                            the disk where important files are stored. Damage caused can result in information losses from
                            individual files or even entire directories.

                        <p>They are not considered viruses because they do not replicate. They are not even programs in
                            their own right but rather camouflaged segments of other programs.
                            Their objective is to destroy data on the computer once certain conditions have been met. Logic
                            bombs go undetected until launched and the results can be destructive.

            <h3>How do I know if a virus has infected my computer?</h3>
            <p><b>Here are a few primary indicators that your system might be infected:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Run consistently slow</li>

            <h3>Install Anti-virus</h3>
            <p>What is Antivirus program? An antivirus is a program that searches for, identifies and removes
                potential viruses existing in the computer system.
                <b>List  of common anti-virus:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Microsoft antivirus</li>
                    <li>Avast</li>

            <p><b>Precautionary prevent virus invasion:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Don’t open suspicious attachments</li>
                    <li>Don’t open suspicious attachments</li>
                    <li>Always keep your anti-virus software up-to-date by installing latest updates</li>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Methods of Eliminating Viruses</h3>
            <p><b>Generally, the antivirus adopts one of two methods to eliminate the virus:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Removing the virus:</b> When the virus can be easily identified and can be removed
                        without affecting other files, then the antivirus removes it from the host place
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Quarantine:</b> this is done when the virus cannot be easily identified removed from the
                        file and the removal of virus means the removal of the complete file. In this method,
                        although the virus is not eliminated, it is rendered inactive by moving the file into
                        quarantine and renaming it.
                        </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>What if the Antivirus Fails?</h2>
            <p>It may happen that your antivirus fails to detect and get rid of the virus. 
                <b>In such a case, you can
                    follow the steps given below:-</b>
                    <ul class="kb">

            <h2>Unit 3: Identify and take action to stop spam</h2>
            <h3>What is spam?</h3>
            <p>Spam is any kind of <b>unwanted, unsolicited digital communication that gets sent out in bulk.</b>
                Often spam is sent via email, but it can also be distributed via text messages, phone calls, or
                social media.
            </p>
            <p>E-mail(electronic mail) is the exchange of computer-stored messages by tele communication.  Email messages are usually encoded in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) text. However, you can also send non text files,  such as graphic images and sound files  as attachments sent in binary streams.</p>
            <h3>Types of spam</h3>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>Phishing emails:</b> are a type of spam cybercriminals sends to many people, hoping to ―hook‖ a few
                    people. Phishing emails trick victims into giving up sensitive information like website logins or
                    credit card information. 
                </li>
                <li><b>Email spam:</b> targets individual users with direct mail messages. Email spam lists are often
                    created by scanning Usenet postings, stealing internet mailing lists, or searching the web for
                    addresses.
                </li>
                <li><b>Tech support scams:</b> the spam message indicates that you have a technical problem and you
                    should contact tech support by calling the phone number or clicking a link in the message.
                </li>
                <li><b>Malspam:</b> Short for malware spam or malicious spam, malspam is a spam message that delivers malware
                    to your device. Unsuspecting readers who click on a link or open an email attachment end up with
                    some type of malware including ransomware, Trojans, bots, info-stealers, cryptominers, spyware,
                    and keyloggers.
                </li>
                <li><b>Spam calls and spam texts:</b> call or text message from an unknown sender
                    urging you to click an unknown link;that referred to as text message spam or smishing, a
                    combination of SMS and phishing.</li>
                <li><b>Email spoofing</b> spoofed emails mimic or spoof an email from a legitimate sender, and ask you to take some sort of action. Well-executed spoofs will contain familiar branding and content, often from a large well-known company such as PayPal or Apple.</li>
                <li><b>Advance-fee scams:</b> this type of spam is likely familiar to anyone who has been using email since the 90s or 2000s. Sometimes called ―Nigerian prince‖ emails as that was the purported message sender for many years, this type of spam promises a financial reward if you first provide a cash advance. The sender typically indicates that this cash advance is some sort of processing fee or earnest money to unlock the larger sum, but once you pay, they disappear. To make it more personal, a similar type of scam involves the sender pretending to be a family member that is in trouble and needs money, but if you pay, unfortunately the outcome is the same.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps you can take to help protect yourself against falling for a scam:-</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li><b>Learn and understand spot phishing</b>
                        <p>All of us can fall victim to phishing attacks. We may be in a rush and click a malicious link without realizing. <br>
                            <ul class="kb">
                                <li>Sender's email address: If an email from a company is legitimate, the sender's email address should match the domain for the company they claim to represent. Sometimes these are obvious, like example@abkljzr09348.biz, but other times the changes are less noticeable, like example@paypa1.com instead of paypal.com.</li>
                                <li>Missing personal information: If you are a customer, the company should have your information and will likely address you by your first name. A missing personal greeting alone isn't enough to spot a phishing email, but it's one thing to look for, especially in messages that say they are from a company with whom you do business. Receiving an email that says your account has been locked or you owe money is cause to worry, and sometimes we rush to click a link in order to fix the problem. If it‘s phishing, that‘s exactly what the sender wants, so be careful and check if the email is generic or addressed specifically to you. </li>
                                <li>Links: Beware of all links, including buttons in an email. If you get a message from a company with whom you have an account, it's wise to log in to your account to see if there is a message there rather than just clicking the link in the message without verifying first. You can contact the company to ask if a suspicious message is legitimate or not. If you have any doubts about a message, don't click any links. </li>
                                <li>Grammatical errors: We all make them, but a company sending out legitimate messages probably won‘t have a lot of punctuation errors, poor grammar, and spelling mistakes. These can be another red flag to indicate that the email could be suspect. </li>
                                <li>Too-good-to-be-true offers: Many phishing messages pretend to be from large, well-known companies, hoping to ensnare readers who happen to do business with the company. Other phishing attempts offer something for free like cash or a desirable prize. The saying is often true that if something sounds too good to be true it probably is, and this can be a warning that a spam message is trying to get something from you, rather than give you something. </li>
                                <li>Attachments: Unless you are expecting an email with attachments, always be wary before opening or downloading them. Using anti-malware software can help by scanning files that you download for malware. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Report spam</b>
                        <p>Email providers have gotten pretty good at filtering out spam, but when messages make it through to your inbox, you can report them. This is true for spam calls and text messages, as many carriers give you the ability to report spam as well. You can also choose to block the sender, often in the same step as reporting the message. 
                            <br>Reporting spam can help your email provider or phone service carrier get better at detecting spam. If legitimate emails get sent to your spam filter, you can report that they should not be marked as spam, and that also provides useful information on what should not be filtered. Another helpful step is to add senders you want to hear from to your contacts list proactively. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Use two factor-authentication(2FA)</b>
                        <p>With two-factor or multi-factor authentication, even if your username and password are compromised via a phishing attack, cybercriminals won‘t be able to get around the additional authentication requirements tied to your account. Additional authentication factors include secret questions or verification codes sent to your phone via text message. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Install cyber security</b>
                        <p>In the event that you click a bad link or download malware sent to you via spam, good cyber security software will recognize the malware and shut it down before it can do any damage to your system or network. With products for home and business, Malwarebytes has got you covered wherever technology takes you.  </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Configuring spam filter </b>
                        <p>Spam filter can reduce the amount of junk mail
                            delivered to a user's inbox.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
