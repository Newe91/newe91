        <h3>Distinguishing characteristics of entrepreneurial mindset </h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li>
                    <b>Independent</b>
                    <p>This is one of the most important aspects of the entrepreneurial mindset. Entrepreneurs don't follow the crowd or look to others to be given instructions. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Responsible</b>
                    <p>The independent mindset of successful entrepreneurs stems from taking full responsibility. Entrepreneurs don’t blame others for their life situation they empower themselves by taking responsibility for improving it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Abundant</b>
                    <p>A key part of the entrepreneurial mindset is abundance. Entrepreneurs know they can improve a situation, make more money and create new opportunity. The sky is always the limit. As a result, entrepreneurs don’t hoard money or knowledge. They are open, generous and understand that “you get what you give.”</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Goal-oriented</b>
                    <p>Entrepreneurial thinking is goal-orientated. In other words, successful entrepreneurs don't have wishes and dreams they have goals and plans.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Not afraid of failure</b>
                    <p>When learning how to think like an entrepreneur, you need to look at failure differently to most people. Entrepreneurs don’t fear failure – they appreciate it. Each “failure” is simply a stepping stone to learn from, helping to move you closer to success.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Growth-oriented</b>
                    <p>Entrepreneurs believe that they can grow as people, learn new things, and develop new skills. They believe that with some consistent effort they can shape themselves into whoever they want to be.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Feedback-seeking</b>
                    <p>The most successful entrepreneurs aren't worried about looking cool they just want to succeed, and they know that learning from feedback will help speed up the process.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Learning-oriented</b>
                    <p>Most people spend their spare time seeking entertainment, whether it's social media, Netflix, gaming, reading novels, or hanging with friends. However, entrepreneurial thinking is more concerned with learning and development. For example: Instead of watching TV, entrepreneurs may take an online course to help them move toward their goals.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Forward-thinking</b>
                    <p>If you want to learn how to think like an entrepreneur, you need to think long-term. Successful entrepreneurs know that big goals take a long time to achieve. So, they start with their goal and work backward, reverse-engineering every step of the way. In other words, “If I want this, I need to do that. But to do that, I need to do this,” and so on.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Self-accepting</b>
                    <p>Many people struggle with self-acceptance. When you don't like something about yourself, it’s easy to devalue or even hate yourself. But if you develop a growth mindset, you know you can always change and improve. So, successful entrepreneurs accept themselves as they are, warts and all. They know who they are is transient, and they're working on becoming the person they want to be.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Self-aware</b>
                    <p>Entrepreneurs practice self-awareness. They pay close attention to their strengths and weaknesses, which allows them to improve faster and play to their strengths.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Collaborative</b>
                    <p>Great businesses require teamwork after all; Jeff Bezos didn’t build Amazon alone. So, if you want to think like an entrepreneur, you need to think in terms of “we” instead of “I.”</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Comfortable with discomfort</b>
                    <p>Courage leads to an essential entrepreneurial mindset characteristic: learning to be comfortable with discomfort. Growth and expansion require you to move beyond your comfort zone. So, when developing an entrepreneurial mindset, someone should overcome any uncomfortable feeling such as rejection.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Adaptable</b>
                    <p>Entrepreneurs have big goals, and they know it's impossible to see the entire staircase before climbing. But they climb anyway, safe in the knowledge that they can always adapt to new developments.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Problem-solving</b>
                    <p>Entrepreneurs look for problems and try to find ways to solve them. If you think about it, this is the essence of every business. For instance, plumbers fix broken pipes; Netflix cures boredom, and car manufacturer's help people get around.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Driven and tenacious</b>
                    <p>Drive is an essential part of the entrepreneurial mind. Entrepreneurs are self-motivated and driven to achieve their goals. They work hard and enjoy the ride, knowing that they'll reap the rewards down the line. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Focused</b>
                    <p>Successful entrepreneurs are focused on achieving their goals. They're focused, never procrastinate, and always prioritize the most important tasks. To do this, ask yourself, “Will this help me to achieve my long-term goals?” If the answer is yes, then ask, “Is this the most important thing to do right now?”</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Action-oriented</b>
                    <p>Entrepreneurs have a bias for action. They know that knowledge without action is meaningless. As the entrepreneur Walt Disney said, “The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.”</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Decisive</b>
                    <p>The entrepreneurial mind is decisive. Entrepreneurs must confront problems and make many decisions every day often with inadequate information to help. So practice decisiveness for example, you are in a restaurant, look at the menu once, decide, and order with confidence.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Positive mindset to work</h3>
        <p>There are several factors that may contribute to unhappiness at work ; like a difficult supervisor, tasks that are too mundane, too stressful, or too difficult, challenging coworkers, or maybe just a general dissatisfaction with where you are as opposed to where you want to be in your career. 
            The good news is that job satisfaction has much more to do with internal factors such as having positive expectations, developing a healthy self-image, and being flexible than it does external factors  such as the work itself or the people it involves. Research confirms that we are only as happy or unhappy as we make up our minds to be, therefore, we each have the power to choose if we want to respond to our jobs and to the world around us positively or negatively. 
        </p>

        <p>Work habits refer to a person's characteristic approach to work, including such things as organization priority setting, and handling of paperwork and e-mail.

        <h3>Procrastination</h3>
        <p>Procrastination is delaying of a task for an unacceptable or weak reason. </p>

        <h3>Common reasons procrastinate:-</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Thinking that the task to be done (such as quitting a job) is unpleasant</li>
                <li>Another reason we procrastinate is that we find the job facing us to be difficult</li>
                <li>A fear of the consequences of our actions</li>
                <li>Negative evaluation of your work</li>
                <li>The fear of success</li>
                <li>A way of rebelling against being controlled</li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Techniques for reducing procrastination</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>
                    <b>Calculate the cost of procrastination </b>
                    <p>You can reduce procrastination by calculating its cost. One example is that you might lose out on obtaining a high-paying job you really want by not having your résumé and cover letter ready on time. Your cost of procrastination would include the difference in salary between the job you do find and the one you really wanted. Another cost would be the loss of potential job satisfaction. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Counter attack</b>
                    <p>Forcing yourself to do something difficult, frightening, or uncomfortable helps you to prove that the task was not as bad as initially perceived. Assume that you have accepted a new position but have not yet resigned from your present one because resigning seems so uncomfortable. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Jump-start yourself</b>
                    <p>You can often get momentum going on a project by giving yourself a tiny assignment simply to get started. One way to get momentum going on an unpleasant or overwhelming task is to set aside a specific time to work on it. If you have to write a report on a subject you dislike, you might set aside specific day and time as your time to first attack the project. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Peck away from overburden task </b>
                    <p>A good way of minimizing procrastination is doing a task bit by bit, by breaking down to manageable size and, therefore, not seem so overwhelming too much burden. 
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Motivate yourself with rewards and punishments</b>
                    <p>Give yourself a pleasant reward soon after you accomplish a task about which you would ordinarily procrastinate. You might, for example, have a walk through the forest after having completed a tough take-home exam. Punish yourself if you have engaged in serious procrastination. 
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Follow the WIFO principle</b>
                    <p>This principle recommends that you use the technique of worst in, first out (WIFO) for dealing with unpleasant tasks you would prefer to avoid. A related motivational principle is that after completing the unpleasant task, moving on to a more pleasant (or less unpleasant) task functions as a reward. 
                        </p>
                </li>

        <h3>There are two main approaches to define MSEs such as:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>By some measure of size or quantitative approach</b>
                    <p><b>Examples of Criteria used to measure size or quantitative approach are:-</b>
                        <ul class="kb">
                            <li>Number of employees is the most widely used criteria because it is inflation proof, transparent, comparable, and available
                            <li>The best criteria in any case depends up on the user's</li> 
                            <li>Volume or value of sales turnover</li>
                            <li>Asset size,insurance in force,volume of deposits,total capital investment</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Using an economic or control definition or qualitative approach</b>
                    <p>
                        <ul class="kb">
                            <li><b>Market share:</b> The characteristic of a small firm's share of the market is that it is not large enough to enable it to influence the prices of national quantities of goods sold to any significant extent. </li>
                            <li><b>Independence:</b> Independence means that the owner has control of the business himself. It, therefore, rules out those small subsidiaries which though in many ways fairly autonomous, nevertheless have to refer to major decisions.</li>
                            <li><b>Personalized management:</b> It is the most characteristics factor of all. It implies that the owner actively participates in all aspects of the management of the business, and in all major decision-making process. There is little delegation of authority. One person is involved when anything material is involved.</li>
                            <li><b>Technology:</b> Small business is generally labor intensive. Only few are technology intensive.</li>
                            <li><b>Geographical area of operation:</b> The area of operation of a small firm is often local.
                                Generally, small business is a business that is privately owned and operated, with a small number of employees and relatively low volume of sales. Small businesses are normally privately owned companies, partnerships, sole proprietorships, or cooperatives.</li>

He also has the guarantee that no other franchisee from the same franchiser will have the right to do business in the same area.

        <h3>Definition of marketing</h3>
        <p><b>Selling</b> is the art of finding clever ways to dispose of what you make. It focuses on creating sales transactions rather than on building long-term, profitable customer relationships.

            <li>Who are your customers?</li>
            <li>What are my customer's needs and wants?</li>
            <li>3Understanding the market place and customer needs </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Importance of marketing</h3>
        <p>Marketing plays a major role in achieving organization goal and socio-economic system of a given country and further in the global economy. Since marketing is consumer oriented, it has a positive impact on the business firms. It enables the entrepreneurs to improve the quality of their goods and services.

        </p>

        <h3>The five core customer and marketplace concepts:-</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li>
                    <b>Customer needs, wants and demands </b>
                    <p><b>Need:</b> Human needs are states of felt deprivation. They include basic physical needs for food, clothing, warmth, and safety; social needs for belonging and affection; and individual needs for knowledge and self-expression. Marketers did not create these needs; they are a basic part of the human makeup. 
                    <br><b>Wants:</b> wants are the form human needs take as they are shaped by culture and individual personality. Example a person in Ethiopia needs food but wants Burger. Wants are shaped by one's society and are described in terms of objects that will satisfy those needs. 
                    <br><b>Demand:</b> when backed by buying power, wants become demands. Given their wants and resources, people demand products and services with benefits that add up to the most value and satisfaction.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Market offerings products, services and experiences</b>
                    <p>Consumers needs and wants are fulfilled through market offerings—some combination of products, services, information or experiences offered to a market to satisfy a need or a want. 
                    Market offerings are not limited to physical products. They also include services activities or benefits offered for sale that are essentially intangible and do not result in the ownership of anything.

            <ul class="listno">
                <li>
                    <b>Competitive world</b>
                    <p>In a world it is difficult to judge the individuality of the candidate? Many might say that college is different. Though, that is true in some sense. The larger point is that the basic education for every one is the same. However, even good colleges can just offer good jobs to their students. Retaining that job defines that student. Thus, this is the unique factor in each candidate.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Adapt to changing situations</b>
                    <p>Work-life is fickle. As they say, the market can change every second. So can the insides of an office. Not just in terms of emotions, the real change comes in the form of changes to job descriptions. Over time, you will go up the ranks of the company. You will be required to do various jobs that are needed at different stages. Hence, employability helps you gather and retain these traits.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Helps you explore self</b>
                    <p>The best thing about employability is that it is entirely in your hands. Thus, only you can find your true employability. Thus, exploring yourself urges you to become employable. You try to learn new things. Also, you retain more information for future use. And, you go through many work lives to finally select the one that works for you.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Return on investment</b>
                    <p>Costs for completion of higher education are getting higher every year. Students are walking out of colleges with large debts and are in need of a job. This is why maintaining employability is important.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>A degree is not enough</b>
                    <p>Truthfully, in today's day and age, even students from well-reputed colleges are lacking job opportunities because they have not developed their skills in different areas. Though, Having managerial skills, even in non-business related fields like medicine, greatly improves your employability.

        <h3>The cover letter is all about specifics:-</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Always address the letter to a specific person. “Dear Sir” or “To Whom It May Concern” is unacceptable. Call the company and ask who the hiring manager is for a given position if it isn't stated in the job posting. The worst-case scenario is that the letter will begin “Dear Hiring Manager for (name of position).” This is the way an applicant should address a blind job ad also.</li>
                <li>Target the letter to a specific position and be very specific when describing the skills and qualifications related to that position. Be sure to refer to the job posting and use key words mentioned. Use specific examples to demonstrate the claims about yourself. If An applicant say An applicant are organized, give an example of how An applicant have used this skill.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate specific knowledge of the company An applicant are writing to. This isn’t a must, but will help to grab the attention of a potential employer. It shows An applicant took extra time to research what they are about.</li>
                <li>Specifically ask for an interview and tell the company how an applicant will follow up. If An applicant take this proactive approach and follow up, An applicant will be much more likely to get an interview.</li>

        <h3>Tips for completing a job application</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Follow all directions printed on the job application. Look the application over carefully before an applicant begins working on it. Show the employer that an applicant can do what is expected of you.</li>
                <li>Fill out the application yourself. Employers want to know how well an applicant read and write, not how well the friend or parents can write.</li>
                <li>Print using black ink. Printing is much easier to read. Use the best penmanship.</li>
                <li>Think before an applicant write to avoid mistakes. If an applicant does make mistakes, draw one line through it. Don't blot it out!</li>
                <li>Have all of the data handy. It is a good idea to fill out a “pocket resume” or extra application ahead of time and take it with you. Then an applicant will have all of the information ready.</li>
                <li>Be as specific as possible with all answers.</li>
                <li>Be specific about employment history in the application. Make sure an applicant know starting and ending dates of all the jobs. Employers are looking for a complete work history, including gaps in employment.</li>
                <li>Proofread the application before submitting it. Don't forget to sign it and be sure to read what  an applicant are signing.</li>
                <li>Salary desired? Do not pin yourself down to a dollar figure. An applicant may: oversell yourself and the employer will think an applicant is  too expensive  undersell yourself and ask for less than the employer was planning on paying for that position.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Some common sources of job information</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>Word of mouth or networking</b> The best source is the old reliable “grapevine.” Ask around! Ask family, friends, neighbors, and co-workers if they know of any businesses who are hiring. Talk with the parents of the friends. Ask them for leads and let them know an applicant is looking for a job. More job leads are discovered through networking than any other method.</li>
                <li><b>Pounding the Pavement</b> This is the oldest method of job hunting, especially for entry-level positions. This means literally going door-to-door and submitting job applications. Be sure to always dress professionally for those rare occasions where an applicant may be interviewed on the spot.</li>
                <li><b>Help wanted Signs</b> Maybe the simplest method of all is the good old “Help Wanted” sign in the front window. If an applicant sees one, don't go in right away. Take some time to prepare. Practice writing a cover letter and prepare a resume. Also, brush up on how to fill out a job application and practice the interviewing skills.</li>
                <li><b>Public employment agencies</b> Youth Opportunities Unlimited (YOU) provides various career services including job placement assistance for students in Kalamazoo County.

                <li><b>Newspapers</b> Usually list jobs under the “Help Wanted” column of the classified ads. Many newspapers are now putting their Help Wanted ads on their websites. These are usually unique listings specific to a certain location.</li> 
                <li><b>List of employers</b> Check the yellow pages of the telephone book, industrial directories, and the local Chamber of Commerce listings. They will tell an applicant about local businesses or employers.</li>
                <li><b>Government</b> Civil Service Commission jobs involve working for the local, state, or federal government. In order to get a civil service job, an applicant must take a civil service occupation-specific test. Candidates for civil service jobs are then contacted based on their test score. Most post offices have application forms and information on civil service opportunities. The armed forces offer job training and career opportunities.</li>
                <li><b>Unions</b> Industrial and trade unions have exclusive hiring authority for some companies, usually through apprenticeship programs.</li>

                <li>Follow directions. Be careful to enter the correct data in the correct field.</li>
                <li>Tailor the information to the position. Don't copy and paste text from the resume.</li>
                <li>Use key words, buzz words and industry verbiage. Use the verbiage in the job ad as the model. Employers search key words when they're looking for people to fill specific positions. Key words are very important and will help an applicant get past the computer to a live person.</li>
                <li>Create a skills-inventory section even if the application doesn't require it. An applicant might put this in a “comments” section.</li>
                <li>Include numbers and statistics if available. Example counted five cash drawers daily and responsible.</li>
                <li>Complete all fields  even those that aren't required.</li>
                <li>If the company offers an optional assessment test online, take it. Some employers have said that candidates who don't take the optional assessment test are automatically screened out.</li>
                <li>Make sure the resume can hold its own in a very simple format. Fancy bullets, text, italics, and bold do not convert well in an electronic application.</li>

                <li>Include a strong objective tailored to the specific job for which an applicant is interested.</li>
                <li>Another use for the comments section: use it to demonstrate that you've done research on the company and the industry.</li>
                <li>Follow-up the electronic application with a personal e-mail to the hiring manager. A follow-up phone call is acceptable if the ad does not say “No phone calls.”</li>
