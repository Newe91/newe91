        <h2>Unit 1: Document and update inventory</h2>
        <h3>Inventory concept and principles</h3>
            <p><b>Inventory: </b>is comprehensive detail information about the hardware and software of the computer system.
                <br><b>The Hardware inventory details include information</b> like, memory, operating system, manufacturer,
                device types, peripherals, etc.<br>
                <b>The Software inventory provides details</b> of the software by software vendors. It also provides the license compliance details of the software and software metering.  
            </p>
        <h3>Features of Inventory</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Complete Hardware and Software Inventory</li>
                    <li>Manage Software Licenses</li>
                    <li>Software usage statistics</li>
                    <li>Comprehensive reports on hardware, software inventory and license agreement.</li>
                    <li>Detect Prohibited Software in the network</li>
                    <li>Scan the systems periodically to collect the hardware and software details</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h3>Types of inventory</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Raw materials:</b> The inventory you use to make your finished goods</li>
                    <li><b>Finished goods or for-sale goods:</b> The products you sell to your customers</li>
                    <li><b>Work-in-progress:</b> Essentially, unfinished goods</li>
                    <li><b>MRO goods:</b> MRO stands for maintenance, repair and operating. This is the inventory you use to
                        support the manufacturing process</li>
                    <li><b>Safety stock:</b> The additional inventory you keep in store to deal with supplier shortages or surges in
                        demand</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h3>Key principles of inventory</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Demand Forecasting</b></li>
                    <li><b>Warehouse Flow</b></li>
                    <li><b>Inventory Turns or Stock Rotation</b></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h3>Inventory techniques</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li><b>Just-in-time (JIT) inventory:</b> JIT involves holding as little stock as possible, negating the costs and
                        risks involved with keeping a large amount of stock on hand</li>
                    <li><b>ABC inventory analysis:</b> This technique aims to identify the inventory that is earning you profit, by
                        classifying goods into different tiers</li>
                    <li><b>Drop shipping:</b> Businesses that use drop shipping essentially outsource all aspects of managing stock
                        with several benefits but a few key drawbacks</li>
                    <li><b>Bulk shipments:</b> This technique is based on the assumption that buying in bulk is cheaper. The method
                        is great if a business is sure that their products will sell but can pose challenges when demand suddenly
                        changes</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h3>Fragile components</h3>
            <p>Fragile components such as memory and expansion cards need to be held on the outer edges. These components
                are made up of chips, transistors and wires that hold memory and transport information.</p>
        <h3>Heavy equipment</h3>
            <p>Heavy equipment, such as system units and monitors, should be placed correctly onto a trolley with wheels, so
                they can be moved with ease.</p>

        <h3> Inventory procedures </h3>
            <p>Every business will apply its own way of inventory control. However, at the end of the day, managing stock
                efficiently is the target that everybody wants to achieve. There are a few common procedures and inventory
                management best practices that can instruct you on how to manage inventories more efficiently.

        <h2>Unit 2: Store technical documentation</h2>
        <h3>Store equipment, software and documents securely</h3>
        <p>Stock describes the goods that an organization currently holds. For example, if an organization makes
            computers, they need to keep a stock of hard disks, system boards, network cards, monitors, cabling and so on.</p>
        <h3>Stock Control</h3>
        <p>Stock control is an important part of running a business efficiently. If your stock runs out, customers may not
            receive their goods when they want them or when you had promised. If this happens, you may well lose
            customers. If they tell others about their experience, your organization might even gain a bad reputation.</p>
        <h3>Stock levels</h3>
        <p>Inventory-control systems are used to maintain an optimum level of stock. Some companies use a system called
            just-in-time. This means that they keep minimal stock and then they order more just before, or as, it is needed.</p>
        <h3>Accessing stock and inventory control</h3>
        <p>Entry of data into an inventory system may be done by either a stores person, an operator or a clerk who
            receives the information in a stock request or requisition form (generated by people needing more stock), or via
            delivery notes (from stores when new stock arrives). In the case of large supermarkets, when a purchased item
            is scanned at the checkout, the inventory system reduces the number of items in stock automatically by one.</p>

        <h3>Factors that influence the level of inventory</h3>
        <p>Factors that can influence the level of inventory, or the number of any item held in store, include:
            Operational needs: <b>The Company may be expanding or reducing in numbers of people, or the amount of
            business it does.</b>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li><b>Shelf life:</b> Some items including software have a use-by or expiry date</li>
                <li><b>Delivery:</b> How long it takes to get an item from the supplier; the longer it takes to deliver, the more
                    items that have to be kept in store to protect the organization from delays</li>
                <li><b>Installation:</b> How fast a product can be installed; if quickly, there needs to be an adequate supply to
                    keep up with the number of installations</li>
                <li><b>Costs:</b> How much money is available to invest in stock not actually being used? How much money is
                    available to rent storage space</li>
                <li><b>Storage capacity:</b> How much room is available, Store room design, layout, location and security</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><b>Factors that can influence decisions
            about IT store rooms include:-</b>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>The size and complexity of the IT system or network</li>
                <li>Money and space available for building space and fittings</li>
                <li>Policies on delivery from suppliers and distribution to clients</li>
                <li>Location of the IT functions in relation to the rest of the organization</li>
                <li>Future plans for expansion</li>
                <li>Design considerations</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Locating stores</h3>
        <p><b>The location of storeroom facilities will be influenced by factors, including the:-</b>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Expense</li>
                <li>Volume</li>
                <li>Access</li>
                <li>Size</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Stock rotation</h3>
        <p>Ensure that the oldest stock is
            used first is a technique called stock rotation</p>

        <h3>Storing computer equipment</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Remove batteries and ink cartridges and detach cables and peripherals</li>
                <li>Protect against ESD</li>
                <li>Wrap fragile items</li>
                <li>Choose the right container for storing electronics</li>
                <li>Add a desiccant and seal the container</li>
