        <h2>Unit 1: Develop morality</h2>
        <h3>Concept of morality</h3>
        <p>Morality comes from a Latin word <b>mores</b> meaning custom, habit, manner, character or proper behavior. Therefore, the manners you learn like politeness of behavior, way of saluting, or giving helpful hands for elders, showing sympathy to people during sadness are valued as morality.</p>

        <h3>Morality may be applied to four areas:-</h3>
        <p><ul class="listno">
            <li>Religion</li>
            <li>Nature</li>
            <li>Individuality</li>
            <li>Society</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Who is morally responsible?</h3>
        <p>Should only human beings be held morally responsible? The answer is true.<br>
            Humans have a moral sense because their biological makeup determines the presence of <b>three necessary conditions for ethical behavior:-</b>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li>The ability to anticipate the consequences of one's own actions</li> 
                <li>The ability to make value judgments</li>
                <li>The ability to choose between alternative courses of action.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Where does morality come from?</h3>
        <p>Morality can be considered as having a subjective or objective origin.
            <b>As objective there are three possibilities for the origin of value:-</b>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li>Values are given by a supernatural being.</li> 
                <li>Values are part of the fabric of nature. </li>
                <li>Values are part of the furniture of the world, independently of human beings. 
                </li>
            </ul> 
        </p>

        <h3>Forms of morality</h3>
        <p><b>We can separate morality into two such as:-</b>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>Customary/Traditional morality:</b> refers to the moral systems handed down through custom from generation to generation. We might call this static morality.</li>
                <li><b>Reflective morality:</b></li> requires that moral ideas are carefully examined and tested. Traditional morality can become reflective and dynamic when those moral ideas that are simply handed down and accepted are subjected to analysis and criticism.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Morality and law</h3>
        <p>Morality and law are not the same although of course they overlap. <b>Law</b> might be thought of as a public codification of morality for a culture, although certain laws in that system or even the system itself, might be deemed immoral, e.g., apartheid. Law is not a necessary attribute of morality although morality may well be thought to be a necessary attribute of law.</p>

        <h3>Morality and religion</h3>
        <p>Is morality dependent upon religion? The answer is false.<br>
            <b></b>Morality need not be based exclusively on religion for five reasons:-</b>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li>Supernatural existence cannot be proven.</li>
                <li>Non-religious people can be moral.</li>
                <li>Religious foundation for ethics is difficult to establish.</li>
                <li>No religion would be best ethically.</li>
                <li>We could not show that one religion is best.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Why should human beings be moral?</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Enlightened self-interest</li>
                <li>Tradition and law</li>
                <li>Shared human needs, goals, desires and objectives
                    </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Purpose of morality</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Keep society from falling apart</li> 
                <li>Ameliorate human suffering</li> 
                <li>Promote human flourishing</li> 
                <li>Resolve conflict of interest justly and orderly</li>
                <li>Assign praise, blame, reward, punishment and guilt
                    </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Moral principles</h3>
        <p>Moral principles are principles based on reason and rationality. They guide us on what we should do, what qualities we should nourish, and what kind of lives we should look for. Moreover, the application of moral principles should not be limited to a specific society or culture.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of moral principles</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>Absolute moral principles</b>
                    <p>Absolute moral principles are based on universal truths about the nature of human beings. For example, murder is wrong because it goes against the natural order of things. These are also sometimes called normative moral principles, or those that are generally accepted by society. 
                        <br><b>Some examples of absolute moral principles:-</b>
                        <ul class="kb">
                            <li>Don't kill</li>
                            <li>Speak the truth</li>
                            <li>Be careful with what you say and do to others</li>
                            <li>Respect the property of others</li>
                            <li>Treat people in need or distress as we would want to be treated if our situation were reversed.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Relative moral principles</b>
                    <p>Relative moral principles are based on opinions and circumstances that may change over time or from person to person or for different situations. Relative moral principles depend on a person's beliefs. Relativism is to what people perceive as good or bad in relation to themselves. In other words, when someone says something is good, in most cases they are really saying it is good for them or perhaps it contributes to their well-being.
                        <br><b>Some examples of relative moral principles including:-</b>
                        <ul class="kb">
                            <li>It is morally wrong to spend money on a luxury item.</li>
                            <li>It is morally right to care for our planet and preserve it for future generations.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Impacts of moral principles</h3>
        <p><ul class="kb">
            <li>Societal norms</li>
            <li>Influence relationships</li>
            <li>Behavior</li>
            <li>Decision making</li>
            <li>Personal growth</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3>Steps a person can take to develop good moral principles:-</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li>Think about what you would do when faced with an ethical dilemma and why you would make those decisions.</li>
                <li>Ask yourself what you think is right or wrong and make sure that your actions are in line with those thoughts.</li>
                <li>Watch out for double standards, like being nice to one person while not being so kind to another.</li>
                <li>If it helps, write down a list of moral principles and post them where they're easy to see, like on a mirror or in your workspace.</li>
                <li>Don't worry if you're not perfectly adhering to your moral principles. The important thing is that you are trying your best.
                    </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>The similarity between ethics and morality</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>When ethics represents the judgment of right and wrong, Morality helps support it by refinements.</li>
                <li>Ethics studies the behavior, and Morality provides the practical guidance of that behavior.</li>
                <li>Both the terms are used to indicate a fine line between what activities should be considered good and what should be considered bad.</li>
                <li>Both ethics and morality work side by side to make the learning of good activities faster.</li>
                <li>Both concepts help any individual to be a better person.</li>

                <li>Both the terms are interconnected in the way that Morality helps keep alive the essence of ethics and its value.
                </li>
                <li>Both ethics and morals are rules or principles which govern how we perceive right or wrong.</li>
                <li>In certain situations, morals and ethics might not be in conflict, meaning a person could preserve his/her moral integrity, while respecting the ethical principles of, for example, his/her workplace
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Describing virtues</h3>
        <p>Virtues mean goodness or the state of being good. An example of goodness is volunteering to serve meals at a homeless shelter. Virtues are also attitudes or character that enables us to be and to act in ways that develop our highest potential. They enable us to pursue the ideals we have adopted. Honesty, courage, compassion, generosity, fidelity, integrity, fairness, self-control, and prudence are all examples of virtues.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of virtues</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>Moral virtue</b>
                    <p>Moral virtue is the disposition or tendency to do the right thing and avoid doing wrong. We develop this disposition over time and through training. In other words, a good character is an achievement, not a natural endowment.  “Doing right” becomes second nature to us, if we have developed our moral character properly. We must strive to achieve a virtuous character, and we do this by constantly practicing the virtues and thereby developing a good character.<br>
                        <b>The four fundamental moral virtues are courage, temperance, justice and prudence.</b><br>There are also other moral virtues include: trustworthiness, honesty, generosity, civility, sincerity, gentleness, reliability, warmth, dependability, cooperativeness, empathy, tact, kindness, tolerance, benevolence etc... 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Civic virtues</b>
                    <p>Civic virtue is an important concept in many contemporary societies and it has been for a long time. Essentially, civic virtue means that individuals have a duty to their communities and their societies that they should place above their own desires.<br>
                        <b>Important characteristics of civic virtue:-</b>
                        <ul class="kb">
                            <li><b>Self-sacrifice:</b> putting the needs of a community over one's own needs is one of the most deeply rooted parts of civic virtue.</li>
                            <li><b>Participation:</b> participation in government and in the community is part of what makes one a good citizen.</li>
                            <li><b>Doing one's part:</b> the idea of civic virtue is that each individual has their own duties that help make society function as well as possible.</li>
                            <li><b>Cooperation:</b> being a cooperative member of society, obeying the law, and working well with others are some of the things that proponents of civic virtue promote.</li>
                            <li><b>Civility:</b> is a social virtue that is indispensable to open political discourse and reasoned disagreement. A civil person is willing to engage others in respectful dialogue without scorn or insult, even when the issues are intensely important or disagreement runs deep.</li>
                            <li><b>Compassion:</b> is the ability to feel sorrow over another person’s suffering, and to express that sorrow in a way that is intended to alleviate that suffering.</li>
                            <li><b>Fairness:</b> is a central virtue both for individuals and for social institutions. Fairness is characterized by impartiality (a lack of favoritism).</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Ethics virtue:</b> 
                    <p>virtue of Ethics claims that the main task of ethics is to give us knowledge of what is the right type of person or what is a “good” person. And also include duty, prudence/resolution,humility and honor.

                <li>Situations</li>

        <h3>Culture	</h3>
        <p>Culture is a broad term that encompasses various unique ways of doing things in a certain society. It can be divided as material and immaterial culture. Material culture includes clothes, household utensils, tools, houses and ornaments. The immaterial/non material culture includes language, beliefs, values and norms.
        </p>

        <h3>The relation between morality and culture</h3>
        <p>Culture reflects the moral and ethical beliefs and standards that speak to how people should behave and interact with others. They act as prescriptions for correct and moral behavior, lend meaning and coherence to life and provide a means of achieving a sense of integrity, safety and belonging.</p>

        <h3>The difference between morality and culture</h3>
        <p>Normative ethical relativism theory says that the moral rightness and wrongness of actions varies from society to society and that there are no absolute universal moral standards binding on all men at all times. Each culture establishes the basic values and principles that serve as the foundation for morality
        </p>

        <h3>Diverse cultural groups</h3>
        <p>Despite various styles, unique ways of getting things done, it is however, important to treat all cultures equally. Because, having cultural diversity means having different dressing styles, traditional foods, cultural dances etc. making; for example, Ethiopia beautiful and interesting country
        </p>

        <h3>Elements of work place culture</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li>
                    <b>Artefacts</b>
                    <p> Are physical items found to have particular symbolism for a company. This could include an early product line or the napkin that comprised the original idea for the company. Artefacts remind us of things created from an earlier time.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Stories</b>
                    <p>Culture is often disseminated through stories about past events and people. These stories could be true or elaborations on a nugget of truth. The story might be of heroism or just plain luck. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Rituals</b>
                    <p>Rituals are the repeated actions your company takes. These actions might be cantered on ceremonies, such as a promotion or a retirement. They may also be associated with employee celebrations, such as the release of a new product or the closing of a large sale, or they might be companywide, like the annual holiday party. The predictability of the rituals and the depth of their meaning combined to help keep organizational culture strong.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Heroes</b>
                    <p>Heroes are the folks other employees look to emulate. These folks could be anyone throughout the organization, from the founders to new hires. A hero might be a customer success representative who went out of his or her way to delight a customer or the programmer who spent a little extra time to make the latest release contain one fewer bug. These people symbolize and teach others the ideal behaviours and norms of the workplace culture.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Symbols</b>
                    <p>Cultural symbols can be found throughout an organization, from how people greet one another to the clothes each person wears. Symbols can indicate status and trigger certain behaviours. A military uniform is full of symbols. It tells others who salute first and the importance of the person wearing it. An office's decor is also filled with symbols. The style of furniture, items hung and even the colour of the walls all contribute to telling everyone more about the people who inhabit it.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Beliefs</b>
                    <p>People within organizations will often have shared beliefs. These beliefs unify the group's understanding of the world and provide a foundation for action. This can smooth out communication between subgroups but can also become a blinder if not checked.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Attitudes</b>
                    <p>Is your organization laid back, rigid, direct or political? Attitudes are the external manifestations of underlying beliefs that people use to signal to others’ said beliefs. How do people within your organization treat one another? Are people open to change and new ideas or is there a rigorous hierarchy that dictates the attitudes of individuals?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Values</b>
                    <p>Values are the rules that everyone agrees to abide by within the group, and these can be seen throughout all of the other elements of culture. Cultural values shouldn’t just be a list that is framed sitting next to the bathrooms; they should be lived and used to make decisions
                        </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Multiculturalism</h3>
        <p>It is the view that cultures, races, and ethnicities, particularly those of minority groups, deserve special acknowledgment of their differences within a dominant political culture. That acknowledgment can take the forms of recognition of contributions to the cultural life of the political community as a whole, a demand for special protection under the law for certain cultural groups, or autonomous rights of governance for certain cultures. 
            Multiculturalism is both a response to the fact of cultural pluralism in modern democracies and a way of compensating cultural groups for past exclusion, discrimination, and oppression. Most modern democracies comprise members with diverse cultural viewpoints, practices, and contributions. Many minority cultural groups have experienced exclusion or the denigration of their contributions and identities in the past. Multiculturalism seeks the inclusion of the views and contributions of diverse members of society while maintaining respect for their differences and withholding the demand for their assimilation into the dominant culture. 
        </p>

        <h3>Cultural diversity</h3>
        <p>Culture is considered to be the underlying values that direct how people behave. Cultural diversity in the workplace is a result of practices, values, traditions, or beliefs of employees based on race, age, ethnicity, religion, or gender.
        Economic globalization is one of the driving forces of cultural diversity in the workplace. The modern workforce is made up of people of different genders, ages, ethnicity, religions, and nationalities. Employers have realized that workforce diversity provides both material and intangible benefits. 
        </p>

        <h3>Types of diversity in work place</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>Race</b>
                    <p>Race is may be one of the first things you think of when you think about diversity. Employees of colour have often faced challenges — getting hired, being accepted by the co-workers, receiving fair compensation.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Education</b>
                    <p>Not everyone's path to employment is the same. Having a mix of educational backgrounds is a huge asset to an organization, but can also create conflict.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Ethnicity</b>
                    <p>As the workforce becomes more and more global, ethnic diversity might bring about language barriers or cultural differences in how business is carried.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Gender</b>
                    <p>According to the World Economic Forum, it will take 208 years to reach gender equality in the U.S. Cultural diversity in the workplace also applies to gender. </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Religion</b>
                    <p>Religious diversity can impact your staff's dress, dietary requirements and request for particular days off.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Workers with disabilities</b>
                    <p>Diversity in the workplace also applies to workers with disabilities. Whether impairments from vision, learning or mental health, diversity comes in many ways.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Some diversity workplace issues that you might need to address:-</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>
                    <b>Conflict</b>
                    <p>This occurs when discrimination, prejudice, lack of respect, and racism are allowed to fester in a workplace. Intolerant attitudes can turn into open conflict if companies don’t take the correct steps to show that any type of discrimination won't be tolerated.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Harassment</b>
                    <p>Training should be provided as to what constitutes harassment. Employees who harass others should be dealt with according to company procedures. Like all the other issues arising from diversity in the workplace, harassment can have a devastating effect on employees and the company as a whole. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Disregarding needs</b>
                    <p>Some companies ignore the needs of disabled employees by failing to provide them with the necessary equipment to access all facilities and to undertake their jobs. Employers need to lead the way in creating a comfortable workplace for all of its employees, irrespective of whether they have a disability.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Some tips for managing diversity in the workplace:-</h3>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Multiculturalism in Ethiopia	</h3>
        <p>Ethiopia is one of the most diverse nations in the world inhabited around 84 ethnic groups.  The essence of multiculturalism in Ethiopia is to develop harmonious coexistence among people from diverse ethnic, social and cultural backgrounds. Embedding cultural and local knowledge dimensions would enhance learners' ability to deal with different educational and cultural identities constructively to unit a diverse group of individuals for a common national goal. Ethiopian universities are centres of multiculturalism. 
            The current Ethiopian regime has used the ethnic federalism policy to restructure Ethiopia’s geopolitical, social and education policies along ethnic and linguistic lines. The official discourse of Ethiopian ethnic federalism and multicultural policies has emphasized the liberal values of diversity, tolerance, and recognition of minority groups. However, its application has resulted in negative ethnicity and social conflicts among different ethnic groups.
        </p>

        <h3>Advantages of multiculturalism</h3>

            <ul class="listno">
                <li>
                    <b>Obey the company's rules and regulation</b>
                    <p>At the start of an employee contract, companies may need the employee to sign various documents, including the company rules and regulation agreement form. Also, the employee may be given a handbook that may serve as a guide. Some common rules are tardiness, inappropriate dressing and language etc. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Communicate effectively</b>
                    <p>Effective communication is very important to avoid misunderstandings when dealing with issues in the workplace. Communicating effectively may mean different things to people at different points in time. Effective communication may also have an employee breaking one of the rules and regulations of the company without getting penalized for it.  
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Develop professional relationships</b>
                    <p>Good professional relationships are not only a thing that fosters teamwork among employees, but also help with individual career development for employees. Developing professional relationships with coworkers or other professionals outside the workplace will also directly or indirectly improve productivity. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Take responsibility</b>
                    <p>It is important for employees to always take responsibility for decisions made both individually and in a team. This is, in fact, a leadership trait that every employee who is looking to take up a managerial position in the future should exhibit. Understandably, employees may want to save their job and are therefore scared of taking responsibility for a particular event. However, they shouldn't let this fear take them. out of the team.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Professionalism/standards</b>
                    <p>There are professional standards that everything an employee does in the workplace. The use of informal words in a formal workplace is highly unprofessional. These standards should be held high and applied to every part of an employee's activity in the workplace. This should include the way they speak, kind of work they deliver and their relationship with coworkers and customers.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Uphold trust</b>
                    <p>An employee should not do anything that may make his or her employee withdraw trust. As an employee of a company, your employee trusts you to get work done perfectly on time. Things like missing deadlines regularly or delivering work that needs to be revised over and over again will deny you a promotion. It may even leave the employer not giving you tasks to complete in the future—a nightmare for freelancers.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Show initiative without being told</b>
                    <p>Is the company running behind deadline and you feel you can stay a few extra hours after work to finish up? Do it. You are a freelance designer and your client wants a particular poster designed but doesn't have a copywriter to write the content. If you can write the contents, do so. Don't delay a client's work because of a few contents.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Work smarter</b>
                    <p>Don't just work hard, work smarter. The reason why you see an employee promoted to the post of manager after just 2 years and a hardworking employee who has been with the company for 10 years failed to get a promotion is smart work.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Respect all partner</b></li>
                <li><b>Be accountable</b></li>

        <h3>Unethical behaviors in the Workplace</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li>
                    <b>Lies</b>
                    <p>Lying is a trait that is detested in and outside the workplace. It kills trust, affects relationships and may even put people in trouble. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Taking credit for others hard work</b>
                    <p>It is very common for managers to take credit for their team member's hard work when reporting to the management. A team member may have brought an idea that helped the sales team improve their sales by 200%. However, when giving a report, the manager doesn't mention the team member's name but claims the idea as his. Employees need to reduce the use of "I", but embrace the use of “We". By taking credit for another person's work, you will be denying the person a promotion, bonus or commendation for a job well done. This will discourage the person from sharing ideas that will benefit the company in the future.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Verbal harassment/abuse</b>
                    <p>Employees need to stay away from using foul language on coworkers in and out of the workplace. This is very important when dealing with customers. Customers are known to get angry and may result in verbal abuse due to a bad product or service. They may even get insult you when they are at fault. As a customer care representative, salesperson or any other employee, it is important that you don't use abusive words on customers no matter how provoked.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Violence</b>
                    <p>Similar to verbal harassment, employees should not be violent when dealing with coworkers and customers. Customers may likely provoke you, but it is better to keep shut and walk away rather than turn violent.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Non-office related work</b>
                    <p>A lot of employees have side hustles which they use to supplement salaries. This is very good and only very few companies are against employees working to make money outside work hours. However, some employees still do non-office related work during office hours. Employees who have side hustles should try doing them on weekends or employing other people to handle some of the business logistics to avoid eating into office hours to get the work done.

        <h3>Codes of ethics</h3>
        <p>Code of ethics is a guide of principles designed to help professionals conduct business honestly and with integrity. A code of ethics, also referred to as an "ethical code," may encompass areas such as business ethics, a code of professional practice, and an employee code of conduct. A well-written code of conduct clarifies an organization's mission, values and principles, linking them with standards of professional conduct.</p>

        <h3>Types of  codes of ethics</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li>
                    <b>Compliance based code of ethics</b>
                    <p>Compliance-based codes of ethics not only set guidelines for conduct but also determine penalties for violations.This type of code of ethics is based on clear-cut rules and well-defined consequences rather than individual monitoring of personal behavior. Despite strict adherence to the law, some compliance-based codes of conduct do not thus promote a climate of moral responsibility within the company.</p>
                </li>

        <h3>Ethical decision making</h3>
        <p>Decision-Making is necessary in order to deal with conflicting duties, loyalties or interests create moral dilemmas requiring decisions to be made and ethical decision-making involves the ability to distinguish right from wrong along with the commitment to do what is right.  <br>
            Ethical decision making is first based on the distinction between statements that are factual and those that are value-based. Suggested information may be divided into two (true and untrue). It is wise to base decisions on truth and morally accepted facts.  Ethical decisions making is the process of identifying a problem, generating alternatives, and choosing among them maximizing ethical values while also achieving the intended goal.

                <li>Relevant policy and legislation have to be considered </li>
                <li>The advice of others</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Select the best ethical alternative. Resolve any ethical dilemmas-right vs. wrong. Not all ethical responses to a situation are equal.</li>
                <li>Have ethical commitment, ethical consciousness, and ethical competency. Ethical thinking and decision making takes practice.</li>

                <li><b>Deductive reasoning</b> applies a principle to a situation. For instance, if every person has human rights, and you are a person, then you have human rights like every person.</li>
                <li><b>Inductive reasoning</b> involves providing evidence to support a hypothesis.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Unit 3: Develop the practice of patriotic personality</h2>
        <h3>Definition of patriotism</h3>
        <p>Patriotism in a Modern notion is defined with the respect of human rights and constitutional democracy.  It is an appreciation of multiculturalism Whereas Patriotism in a rational meaning defined as sense of attachment to a homeland or the country and alliance with other citizens who share the same sentiment to create a feeling of oneness among the people
        </p>

        <h3>Patriot and nationalist</h3>
        <p><b>Patriot:</b> Expresses the emotion of love towards his country in a passive way
        <br><b>Nationalist:</b> Strives for independence and the interests and domination of a nation and expresses his love or concern for the country in an active political way.
        </p>

        <h3>The Similarity between patriotism and nationalism</h3>
        <p>Patriotism mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force upon other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power
        </p>

        <h3>The difference between patriotism and  nationalism</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Nationalism means to give more importance to unity by way of a cultural background, including language and heritage. Patriotism pertains to the love for a nation, with more emphasis on values and beliefs.</li>
                <li>When talking about nationalism and patriotism, one cannot avoid the famous quotation by George Orwell, who said that nationalism is 'the worst enemy of peace'. According to him, nationalism is a feeling that one's country is superior to another in all respects, while patriotism is merely a feeling of admiration for a way of life. These concepts show that patriotism is passive by nature and nationalism can be a little aggressive.</li>
                <li>Patriotism is based on affection and nationalism is rooted in rivalry and resentment. One can say that nationalism is militant by nature and patriotism is based on peace.</li>
                <li>Most nationalists assume that their country is better than any other, whereas patriots believe that their country is one of the best and can be improved in many ways. Patriots tend to believe in friendly relations with other countries while some nationalists don't.</li>
                <li>In patriotism, people all over the world are considered equal but nationalism implies that only the people belonging to one's own country should be considered one's equal.</li>
                <li>A patriotic person tends to tolerate criticism and tries to learn something new from it, but a nationalist cannot tolerate any criticism and considers it an insult.</li>

        <h3>Two types of approaches toward combating corruption such as:-</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class='listno'>
                <li><b>Preventive approach:</b> It is based on laws of the land starting from the constitution, other laws and rules. It focuses on the preventive role that those laws can play. Example:- Rules related to financial administration.</li>
                <li><b>Curative approach:</b> It includes receiving complaints investigating corruption cases and bring the corrupt officials before justice particularly committed citizens that are vigilant to protect public property are needed to fight against corruption. Such as Whistle blowers, these are people who expose wrong doings unethical activities or criminal acts happening in their surrounding without identifying themselves as a source.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>The basic and integrated anti-corruption approaches </h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li>
                    <b>Political commitment</b>
                    <p>Combating corruption through governmental actions is ultimately a matter of political will. Without genuine political will, government’s promises to reform the civil service or introduce transparency and accountability are unlikely to take place. Unless the leadership is committed, the fight against corruption is incomplete. Accordingly, there has to be a system whereby political leaders play an exemplary role of being ethical and free from corruption. This helps to send message to the public that corrupt act will not be tolerated and no one is above the law. This may include exposing illegal acts of officials and trial of their cases at the appropriate court.   </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Administrative reform </b>
                    <p>Administrative reform is an important ingredient to combat corruption. The following can be cited an element of administrative reform. First, the most basic area is to make institutions effective. This requires eliminating redundant structures; introducing transparent and accountable rules and regulations; sharpening institutional focus on strategic goals for the achievement of maximum results, giving due attention to area that are phone to corruption and better equipping of civil servants for their tasks. In line with this, introducing appropriate living wages to the officials and civil servants; creating suitable working environment including making employment and promotion on the basis of merit are areas that need attention in the administrative aspect to combat corruption. It is also necessary to ensure government decisions and the monitoring of performance on the basis of sound data. On top of that, a properly functioning public administration also requires transparent budgeting and financial management systems with sound expenditure systems.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Transparency and accountability</b>
                    <p>Transparency and accountability are the pillars of democracy and good governance, thus, are important at all levels of governance. If the activities of the government are transparent and officials and civil servants are held accountable for their decisions, the chance for corruption will be minimized. Usually, corruption takes place when there is lack of transparency and accountability.     
                        Transparency is ensured by putting in place such measures as setting standards for timely services, requiring reasons for decision and providing redress against decisions. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Legal framework</b>
                    <p>Legal framework is the other essential mechanism for combating corruption. <b>Under this sub- heading the following legal aspects will be discussed</b>

                                <b>Anti-corruption law</b>
                                <p>Though enforcement is the least effective mechanism to combat corruption, there should be anti- - corruption laws to penalize corrupt officials and civil servants. The anti- corruption law should not only penalize the corrupt but also provide mechanisms for confiscating the property or wealth obtained through corruption. </p>

                                <p>Code of ethics serves bas guide to acceptable and unacceptable behaviour at work place. It includes sanctions, when there is breach of the provision in the code of ethics by those working within the government machinery. The code of ethics should be prepared in line with the need of every government institution or organization.   
                                </p>

                                <p>Conflict interest is any interest is any interest that either directly or indirectly influences the officials and civil servant in the discharge of their duties. In order to avoid conflict of interest, officials and civil servants working in areas that are susceptible to corruption should be required by law to declare and register their assets and financial interests. According to the Canadian experience, for the purpose of registration, assets are classified into three, i.e. exempted assets, declarable assets and controlled assets.  
                                    </p>

                                <b>Whistle-blower protection law </b>
                                <p>The campaign against corruption cannot be successful unless it is backed by the involvement of public. To do so, protection mechanism is needed to encourage the public to expose corrupt officials and civil servants.  Otherwise, the public may not be actively involved due to fear of revenge from corrupt individuals of groups. Similarly, there should be a reporting centre where members of the public may expose corruption without disclosing their identity.

                    <b>Tardiness and absence</b>
                    <p>Chronic employee tardiness affects the workplace in a number of ways. Other employees have to make up the work difference and may feel angry or resentful toward the late employees. People who are chronically late are displaying their disregard for others, even though this may be subconscious. Chronic absences are also workplace factors that can upset balance. When people take more days than allotted or bail out during stressful projects, other workers have to fill in. These factors can lead to stress and negative feelings.

                    <b>Company changes</b>
                    <p>New technologies like new machinery, updated computer systems or new inventory applications can confuse some workers. However, some small business employees look at equipment changes as a work upgrade and appreciate the effort. Changes in staffing, reshuffling of duties and even changes in the coffee served can affect the workplace environment.

                    <b>Lack of opportunities</b>
                    <p>Employee growth opportunities like paid workshops or college courses positively affect the workplace. When workers feel they have the opportunity to learn more and possible advance, they display positive attitudes toward the business. People who are not given the chance to improve may feel underappreciated by their employer. Regular, insightful performance reviews can affect the workplace,

                    <b>Teamwork and dysfunction</b>
                    <p>Employees who work together to meet challenges and reach goals have a positive, uplifting effect on the business. When groups or teams enjoy this kind of camaraderie, it is often infectious and can influence other work groups in the company. On the flip side, departments that don't communicate and lack cohesion achieve little and stimulate no team pride. This type of work dysfunction can affect other departments and may trigger a discouraging domino effect.
