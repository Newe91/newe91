            <h3>What is computer?</h3>
            <p>A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability
                to store, retrieve and process data.</p>
            <p>A collection of instructions that enables a user to interact with the computer</p>
            <h3>Types of software</h3>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Application software</li>
                    <li>System software</li>
                    <li>Driver software and etc...</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Device Drivers</h3>
            <p>A small program that tells the computer how to communicate with peripheral devices.</p>
            <h3>What is Peripheral Devices ?</h3>
            <p>External or tangible devices which are attached to the external part of the computer.
                Any device connected internally or externally to a computer and used in the transfer of data. A personal  computer or workstation processes information and, strictly speaking, that is all the computer does. Data (unprocessed information) must get into the computer, and the processed information must get out. Entering and displaying information is carried out on a wide variety of accessory devices called peripherals, also known as input/output (I/O) devices 
                <br>Any input, output or storage device connected externally or internally to the computer's CPU, such as a monitor, keyboard, printer, disk, tape, scanner, joy stick, paddle or mouse. 
            <h3>Hardware peripheral devices categorized</h3>
                <p><b>1. Input devices:</b> is a device that's been used as a means of input. It is any peripheral (piece of computer hardware equipment) used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or other information appliance.
                    <br><b>List of input devices:- </b></p> 
                    <ul class="listno">
                        <li><b>Mouse</b> or a pointing device is any human interface device that allows a user to input spatial data to a computer. In the case of mice and touch screens, this is usually achieved by detecting movement across a physical surface. Analog devices, such as 3D mice, joysticks, or pointing sticks, function by
                            reporting their angle of deflection. Movements of the pointing device are echoed on the screen by movements of the cursor, creating a simple, intuitive way to navigate a computer's GUI.<br>
                            <b>Types of mouse</b>
                            <ul class="kb">
                                <li><b>Optical-mechanical mouse</b> or Opto-mechanical mouse consists of a ball that rolls one of two wheels inside the mouse. This wheel contains a circle of holes or notches that allow a LED light to be shined through and detected by a sensor, as each wheel spins they represent the X or Y axis for the mouse pointer. This mouse is much more accurate than the traditional mechanical mouse that used only wheels and rollers, however is not as good as an optical mouse. </li>
                                <li><b>Optical mouse</b> Computer mouse that utilizes light-emitting diodes (LED) or laser as a method of tracking movement. These mice are more proficient than other computer mice. These mice are easily identified by examining the bottom of the mouse. If the mouse has no ball or has a light emitting from the bottom it's most likely an optical mouse. This mouse is much more accurate than the ordinary optical mechanical mouse that relies on the traction between the mouse ball and the rollers. One drawback to an optical mouse is they can have problems in bright lights. 
                                    New Optical Mice no longer have the disadvantages of earlier mice and are capable of being utilized on any surface. In comparison to the traditional Optical-Mechanical mouse, the Optical is a much better solution for a computer mouse. </li>

                        <li><b>keyboard</b> is used to input or enter, letters, numbers, symbols, punctuations and commands into the computer. The standard keyboard layout is sometimes called QWERTY layout and it is the most common layout. </li>
                        <li><b>Scanner</b> Scanner is a device that can scan or digitize images on paper and convert them to data that the computer can use. They can then be stored in a file, displayed on the screen, added to documents or manipulated.</li>
                        <li><b>Audio input devices</b> such as Microphone, MIDI keyboard or other digital musical instrument.</li>

                <p><b>3. Processing devices:</b>The Processor or the central processing unit (CPU) is the portion of a computer system that carries out the
                    instructions of a computer program, to perform the basic arithmetical, logical and input/output operations of
                    the system. The CPU plays a role somewhat analogous to the brain in the computer.
                    <br>Two typical components of a CPU are the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which performs arithmetic and logical
                    operations and the control unit (CU), which extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes
                    them, calling on the ALU when necessary.</p>

            <h3>The storage devices</h3>
            <p>Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, refers to computer components and recording media that retain digital data. Data storage is one of the core functions and fundamental components of computers. 
            </p>

            <h3>There are 3 types of storage devices</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="listno">
                    <li>
                        <b>Primary storage</b>
                        <p>Primary Storage  is also known as the main memory or a temporary storage device. It is fast in nature but can accommodate only few data. Data that has been stored in memory flushes off when you restart your computer, thus called temporary storage device. 
                        It is the only one directly accessible to the CPU. The CPU continuously reads instructions stored there and executes them as required. Any data actively operated on is also stored there in uniform manner.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Secondary storage</b>
                        <p>Secondary storage (also known as external memory or auxiliary storage), differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU. The computer usually uses its input/output channels to access secondary storage and transfers the desired data using intermediate area in primary storage. Secondary storage does not lose the data when the device is powered down—it is non-volatile. Examples of a secondary storage device are Internal Hard drive, external Hard Drive, Flash Disk, CD/DVD, Floppy disk, Memory card. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Tertiary storage</b>
                        <p>Tertiary storage or tertiary memory provides a third level of storage.
                            Typically it involves a robotic mechanism which will mount (insert)
                            and dismount removable mass storage media into a storage device according to the
                            system's demands; this data is often copied to secondary storage before use. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Confirming client peripherals</h3>
            <p>To determine appropriate hardware peripheral devices needed within an organization, it is
                important to clearly understand what your client needs. Since, the clients don’t have a clear
                idea of what they want until they have been presented with a series of options. Working out
                clients needs requires careful planning and organization.</p>
            <h3>System development life cycle</h3>
            <p>The system development life cycle is a methodology that computer consultants often follow to
                help them properly investigate the client’s information technology needs within the
                organization. <b>The three stages of the system development life cycle are:-</b>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Planning</li>
                    <li>Analysing</li>
                    <li>Designing</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Planning(Planning stage)</h3> 
                <p>Involves identifying the client’s current technology and taking into account any
                    limitations. <b>During the planning phase it is necessary to find out information including:</b>
                    <ul class="kb">
                        <li>System specifications</li>
                        <li>Connections available</li>
                        <li>Budget constraints</li>
                        <li>Available timeframe</li>
                        <li>Availability of physical space for work activities</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>Analyzing</h3>
                <p>In the analysis phase, the client's requirements are investigated in more depth. It is important to
                    try to gain as much information from the client as possible, in order to obtain an accurate
                    understanding of the situation. <b>Detailed client requirements, such as:</b>
                    <ul class="kb">
                        <li>Specific features of the device required</li>
                        <li>The number of people who will need to use device</li>
                        <li>Support expectations</li>
                        <li>Training requirements can all be obtained during this phase through, interviews,
                            questionnaires, checklists and observations are some methods that consultants use to
                            gather information.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Some methods that consultants use to gather information:-</b>
                    <ul class="kb">
                        <li>
                            <b>Interviews</b>
                            <p>A well-prepared interview can help provide you with valuable information about your client requirements. Information that has been collected during the planning stage can also give you some useful background information when preparing questions. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Questionnaires</b>
                            <p>Questionnaires are helpful when you need to gather information from a number of clients. A number of questions incorporating short answers, multiple choice and true/false choices can help you quickly determine what kinds of features the majority of clients are requiring. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Checklists </b>
                            <p>In a similar manner to questionnaires, checklists that ask clients to choose what features they would like from a specific peripheral device can also provide an efficient way to determine a set of popular requirements. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Observations </b>
                            <p>Even informal observations of current business procedures can provide another way of determining client needs. Observing users as they go about their day-to-day tasks, can confirm if current peripheral devices are not working properly or assessing the need for a new peripheral device. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>Designing</h3>
                <p>
                    The design phase enables you to figure out an effective solution. All the information you have
                    gathered via questionnaires, interviews, observations and during planning can be assessed to
                    determine the best way of satisfying client requirements.</p>
            <h3>Peripherals Requirement Considerations</h3>
                <p>The cost of hardware depends on its
                    specification, which in turn is determined by some key components. When you buy hardware
                    component of computer system, you will need to decide what the specification of these key
                    components should be under taken.</p>
            <h3>Hardware requirement</h3>
                <p>The hardware requirements are the requirements of a hardware device. Most hardware only has
                    operating system requirements or compatibility.<b>Some list of Hardware Requirement:</b> 
                    <ul class="kb">
                        <li><b>Processor:</b> The speed
                            measured by gigahertz (GHz). The higher the GHz, the faster the computer will run.</li>
                        <li><b>Memory(RAM):</b> Used by the processor to run programs. Generally, the more random access
                            memory (RAM) you have, the better your computer will run when using several
                            programs at once.</li>
                        <li><b>Hard disk:</b> Used to store the data.</li>
                        <li><b>DVD-R/RW or CD-R/RW drives</b> and etc...</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>Software requirements</h3>
                <p>Software Requirements deal with defining software resource requirements and pre-requisites
                    that need to be installed on a computer to provide optimal functioning of an application.
                    These requirements or pre-requisites are generally not included in the software installation
                    package and need to be installed separately before the software is installed. 
                    <ul class="kb"><b>Software requirements:</b> 
                        <li><b>1. Platform:</b> Typical platforms include a computer's
                            architecture, operating system, or programming languages and their run time libraries.</li>
                        <li><b>2. APIs and drivers:</b> Software making extensive use of special hardware devices, like high-end display adapters, needs special API
                            or newer device drivers. A good example is DirectX, which is a collection of APIs for handling tasks related
                            to multimedia, especially game programming, on Microsoft platforms.</li>
                        <li><b>3. Web browser</b></li>
                        <li><b>Other pre-requisite requirements:</b> Some software also has other requirements for proper performance. Internet
                            connection (type and speed) and resolution of the display screen are notable examples.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul class="kb"><b>For example Windows 10 system requirements:</b>
                        <li>Latest OS: Make sure you're running the latest version—either Windows 7 SP1
                            or Windows 8.1 Update</li>
                        <li>Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor</li>
                        <li>RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit</li>
                        <li>Hard disk space: 16 GB for 32-bit OS or 20 GB for 64-bit OS</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>Budget constraints</h3>
                <p>While planning the connection of hardware peripheral devices, it is important to be
                    aware of the client’s available budget. A client needs to determine whether the benefits
                    that will be gained from the peripheral device justify the financial outlay. Factors
                    including the organization’s size, the necessity of the peripheral device to the
                    organization, number of people requiring the device, will all contribute to the
                    organization’s allocation of a budget. Costs will sometimes prohibit an organization
                    from proceeding with the purchase of equipment.</p>
            <h3>Available timeframe</h3>
                <p>The time available to complete a task also needs to be considered when identifying
                    client requirements. If, for example, a peripheral device is needed urgently, it will be
                    necessary to quickly find out which suppliers can immediately provide the peripheral
                    equipment.</p>
            <h3>Verifying Client Requirements</h3>
                <p>All Service support providers must test and verify hardware peripherals, confirm client
                    satisfaction and make amendments as required for client, in line with procedures and guidelines
                    to demonstrate client requirements. </p>
            <h3>Ensure client support expectations</h3>
                <p>When it comes to client support, your clients have certain expectations which they
                    expect you to meet consistently. They see you as a single point of contact for assistance
                    in the utilization of the organization’s computing resources and to provide that
                    assistance in a timely and professional manner. <b>They expect you to provide:</b>
                    <ul class="kb">
                        <li>Connectivity</li>
                        <li>Hardware and software support</li>
                        <li>Consultation and training </li>
                        <li>General information and technology recommendations</li>
                        <li>Web-accessible information etc...</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>Ensuring vendor warranty and support services</h3>
            <h3>What is Warranty?</h3>
                <p>A warranty is a guarantee provided by the manufacturer of a product. It assures you the
                    things you buy are of good quality and don't contain manufacturing defects. Warranties give
                    consumers the right to ask the manufacturer to deal with any issues according to their terms
                    and conditions.</p>
            <h3>What is User Manual?</h3>
                <p>A user manual is a document provided to a user that helps in using a particular system,
                    product or service seamlessly. It is also known as an instruction manual or a user guide. Such
                    documents cover detailed information around operations, standards & guidelines,
                    troubleshooting guides, functionalities & more.</p>

            <p>Depending on the type of organization you work for, placing an order for a hardware peripheral device could be done in a variety of ways. In a small organisation you may be responsible for ordering the device yourself. However, in a larger organisation there may be employees who are responsible for purchasing new equipment. You may need to fill out an order form that can be given to the purchasing department. 
                Before an order is submitted, it could also be necessary to obtain final approval from senior staff. Often an order form might require signatures from the manager or supervisor before it can be processed. A purchasing department might require written quotes from three suppliers, a recommendation and justification for the chosen supplier. 
                Make sure that you find out from your supervisor or manager what procedures you need to follow when placing an order within your organisation.
            </p>

            <h3>Entering Peripherals into Equipment Inventory</h3>
            <h3>Hardware inventories</h3>
                <p>The purpose of a hardware inventory (or registry) is to keep detailed information about all
                    the hardware equipment within an organization, As well as providing an excellent quick reference guide to the organization’s hardware, an
                    inventory can be very useful for insurance, warranty and service purposes.
                    <p>There are a number of tools available to create hardware inventories. <b>Databases and spread
                        sheets</b> are often used to store the information</p>
                    <ul class='kb'><b>Details that should be included within a hardware inventory:-</b>
                        <li>Description of hardware device</li>
                        <li>Manufacturer</li>

            <h3>Checking contents </h3>
            <p>When unpacking any peripheral device, an organized and methodical approach needs to be taken. Randomly ripping open boxes and packaging without carefully identifying each component can potentially cause many problems later on. 
                Prepare a suitable work area before you begin unpacking. This should include a large sturdy flat area with no carpet so that small components will not be lost. 
                <br>Before commencing to open any packaging, find the manual for the device. Check instructions for any precautions or specific unpacking procedures. Most manuals will also contain a section that tells you a list of included components. It is useful to create a checklist based on the component list. You will then be able to use the checklist to mark off the components when they have been identified. 
            </p>

            <h3>Storing peripherals</h3>
                <p>Peripheral devices need to be located in a suitable environment; otherwise there may be
                    potential problems. It is a good idea to refer to the manufacturer’s manual to determine what
                    guidelines should be followed. 
                    <ul class="kb"><b>When storing peripherals it is important to:-</b>

            <h3>Storing consumables</h3>
                <p>The term <b>consumables</b> refers to a product that is used once and then replaced. Examples of
                    consumables include printer cartridges, CDs, paper and simple computer accessories.
                    <ul class="kb">
                        <li><b>Paper</b> needs to be stored in an area which is cool and dry, to prevent moisture from fusing pages together. </li>
                        <li><b>Ink cartridges and toner</b> make sure to store cartridges/toner in a cool dry place, away from sparks and open flames, with adequate ventilation and do not expose the device to high temperatures. Also ensure that the cartridges are not taken out of their packaging until they will be used within the printer, as the ink will dry out before use.</li>
                        <li><b>CDs</b>  make sure that CDs are kept in their protective case, to minimise the chances of being scratched. Also keep them out of direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.

            <h2>Unit 3: Connect hardware peripherals</h2>
            <h3>Adjusting installation schedule</h3>
                <p>One of the most important considerations when installing a new hardware peripheral is to try
                    and install the device with the least amount of <b>timeframe for installation, environmental
                    consideration and OH&S standards</b>.
                </p>
            <h3>Best time to schedule hardware installation</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul class="kb">
                        <li>Quiet periods (for example, during holiday periods)</li>
                        <li>Before or after normal office hours</li>
                        <li>While the user is out of the office</li>
                        <li>When the user will not need their computer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>Environmental Consideration and Safety Consideration</h3>
                <p>It can be difficult to work out how long it will take to install a peripheral device. It will vary
                    according to the type of device, current environmental consideration, problems requiring
                    troubleshooting and the experience of the installer.</p>

            <p><b>Driver software:</b> allows computer to recognize new hardware </p>
            
            <h3>Plug and Play</h3>
            <p><b>Plug and Play</b> is a hardware technology that enables many operating systems to automatically recognize new hardware devices and configure them automatically. Most USB devices support plug and play. </p>
            <h3>Connecting and configuring new peripherals</h3>
                <p>With the large variety of computer systems, operating systems, peripheral device types and
                    features and manufacturers, each peripheral device will have its own individual installation
                    procedures. It is important to refer to manufacturer guidelines and manuals when installing any
                    hardware device to ensure that all procedures are correctly followed.</p>
            <h3>Procedures which are generally followed when installing any new peripheral device include:</h3>
                <ul class="kb">
                    <li>Plugging in the cables between the device and computer system</li>
                    <li>Installing driver software for configuration</li>
                    <li>Troubleshooting device installation when necessary</li>
                    <li>Customising the device and updating drivers</li>
                    <li>Testing the device for satisfying required conditions of clients</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Testing hardware peripherals </h3>
                <p>To ensuring a device is able to perform a basic task (such as printing a test page or
                    scanning an image) it is also necessary that all functionality required by the client is tested.</p>
            <h3>All tests should be completed according to a documented test plan.</h3>
                <p>Some suggestions of functions that may be tested for a printer, scanner and digital camera
                    devices are included as follows:- 
                    <ul class="kb"><b>Printer</b> functions that may be tested are:-
                        <li>Can the printer handle different paper types (for example A4, A5, foolscap, thick,
                            thin, overhead transparencies)?</li>
                        <li>Will the printer work successfully on different computers?
                        </li>
                        <li>Will the printer work successfully with different software packages (for example,
                            word processing, spread sheets and desktop publishing)?</li>
                        <li>Is black and white print quality acceptable to clients?</li>
                        <li>Is color print quality acceptable to clients?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul class="kb"><b>Scanner</b>  functions that may be tested are:-
                        <li>Is the resolution of a scanned image an acceptable quality?</li>
                        <li>Does the scanner work correctly with different software packages (e.g. a word
                            processor or desktop publishing package)?</li>
                        <li>Can the scanner handle items of unusual size and thickness (e.g. a large book or
                            cardboard poster)?</li>
                        <li>Does the OCR software scan a document successfully?</li>
                        <li>Will the scanner work successfully on other computers?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <h3>What is a test plan?</h3>
                <p>A test plan is used to work out a structured process to ensure that a new device will work
                    under all expected circumstances. <b>It logically describes:-</b> 
                    <ul class="kb">
                        <li>Functions that need to be tested</li>
                        <li>An example test case scenario</li>
                        <li>Expected results for each scenario</li>
                        <li>What actually happened once the test has been performed?</li>
                    </ul>
