            </ul>

            <h3>System requirements for software installation</h3>
            <p>All computer software needs certain hardware components or other
                software resources to be present on a computer. These per-requisites are known as system
                requirements and are often used as a guideline as opposed to an absolute rule.
                <b>Most software defines two sets of system requirements:-</b><br>
                <b>Minimum specifications</b> are the absolute minimum requirements for hardware you
                should have in your system in order to install and run the OS you have chosen.<br>
                <b>Recommended hardware specifications</b> are what you should have in your system to
                realize usable performance. Recommended requirements are almost always of a significantly higher level than the
                minimum requirements and represent the ideal situation in which to run the software. 
            </p>

            <h3>Hardware requirements</h3>
            <p>The most common set of requirements defined by any operating system or software application is
                the physical computer resources, also known as hardware. A hardware requirements list is often
                accompanied by a Hardware Compatibility List (HCL), especially in case of operating systems. A
                hardware compatibility list is a database of hardware models and their compatibility with a
                certain operating system. An HCL lists tested, compatible and sometimes incompatible hardware
                devices for a particular operating system or application. </p>

            <h3>List of hardware requirements</h3>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li>Central processing unit (CPU)</li>
                <li>Memory (RAM)</li>
                <li>Hard-disk</li>
                <li>Display adapter: Software requiring a better than average computer graphics display, like graphics
                    editors and high-end games, often define high-end display adapters in the system
                    requirements.</li>
                <li>Peripherals: Some software applications need to make extensive and special use of some
                    peripherals, demanding the higher performance of such
                    peripherals. Such peripherals include CD-ROM drives, keyboards, pointing
                    devices, network devices, etc...</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Software requirements</h3>
            <p>Software requirements deal with defining software resource requirements and
                per-requisites that need to be installed on a computer to provide optimal functioning of an
                application. These requirements or per-requisites are generally not included in the software
                installation package and need to be installed separately before the software is installed.</p>

            <h3>List of hardware requirements</h3>
            <ul class="kb">
                <li><b>Platform:</b> Typical platforms include a computer
                    architecture, operating system, or programming languages and their runtime
                    libraries</li>
                <li><b>APIs and drivers:</b> Software making extensive use of special hardware devices, like high-end display
                    adapters, needs special API or newer device drivers. A good example is DirectX,
                    which is a collection of API s for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially
                    game programming, on Microsoft platforms.</li>
                <li><b>Web browser</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Determining client requirements</h3>
            <p>The installation of new software or a software upgrade involves a number of carefully planned
                activities and people who specialize in the installation of computer applications. These activities
                begin with the initial request from the client for new software or a software upgrade.<br>
                <b>Once the
                    client's request has been evaluated, the computer supports person first analyses:- </b>
                    <ul class="kb">
                        <li>The system constraints </li>
                        <li>The current system deficiencies</li>
                        <li>The processes that manipulate the data</li>
                        <li>The corporate desktop software used by the organization. </li>
                        <li>The system components including the capabilities of the clients computer</li>
                        <li>The specific objectives and the performance requirements of the new system</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>

            <p><b>Licensing</b> A supplier of software does not sell you the software; you receive a license to use the
                software only. Therefore you must determine if the client has a current valid license to use
                the software. In some cases the organization may have a site license, where any computer
                belonging to the organization may use the software. In other cases there may be a limited
                number of licenses for specific computers. </p>

            <h3>Type of installations</h3>
            <ul class="listno">
                <li><b>Silent Installation:</b> Installation that does not display messages or windows during its progress.</li>
                <li><b>Unattended Installation:</b> No user present at all, except eventually for the initial launch of the process. </li>
                <li><b>Self-Installation:</b> Unattended installation, without the need of initial launch of the process (i.e. Vodafone
                    Mobile Connect USB Modem or Huawei E220's Mobile Partner software that
                    self-installs from the USB port).</li>
                <li><b>Clean Installation:</b> An installation
                    performed in absence of such interfering factors (which may vary from program to
                    program) is called a clean installation. In particular, a clean operating system installation
                    can be performed by formatting its destination partition before the actual installation
                    process.
                </li>
                <li><b>Flat Installation:</b> An installation of a program performed from a copy (called a flat copy) of its original
                    media contents (mostly CDs or DVDs) to a hard drive, rather than directly from the
                    media.</li>
                <li><b>Network Installation:</b> An installation of program from a shared network drive. This may simply be a copy of
                    the original media (as in a Flat Installation), but frequently, software publishers which
                    offer site licenses for institutional customers provide a version intended for installation
                    over a network.</li>
